**John H** began with a [presentation](http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2015/11/10/files/Why_leap.odp) on the background to the recent release of [openSUSE LEAP 42.1](https://news.opensuse.org/2015/11/04/opensuse-leap-42-1-becomes-first-hybrid-distribution/).




**Alice** then demonstrated using the [Realtime Trains](http://www.realtimetrains.co.uk/) API to download and analyse information about train movements on [Train workings](https://leedstrains.herokuapp.com/); the source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/WheresAlice/raretrains).




**Stephane**, who had joined us for his first meeting, said there were some articles on [his blog](http://nulld1g1t.yourprog.com/wordpress/?cat=4) about using the GPIO on the Raspberry Pi and also mentioned the [Ministry of Freedom](http://minifree.org/) site where you can get Thinkpads with [Libreboot](http://libreboot.org/) installed so that everything on the machine can be free of proprietary code.




**David S** shared [Wierd new tricks for browser fingerprinting](https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/presentations/toorcon2015.pdf), such as using information from [HTML canvas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_canvas) elements or [WebRTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webrtc), generating error messages that contain crucial data and measuring latency under various conditions to identify different browsers.
