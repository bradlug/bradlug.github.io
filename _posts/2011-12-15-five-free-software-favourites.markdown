I first used a computer to produce documentation over thirty years ago but my first experience of free software was just over ten years ago with [xfig](http://www.xfig.org/), a program that was easy to use and had obviously been developed by those who used it. I still use it for simple diagrams but for colour graphics [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) is my program of choice. Developed by professional graphic designers who were dissatisfied with the quality of commercial software, it can create the [SVG images](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) that are needed for the next generation of web design and it has all the tools a creative designer needs; it can also turn your bit-mapped logo into an SVG image for use on your website.

My next was [LyX](http://www.lyx.org/); at the time I needed something which could print maths properly and LyX fitted the bill but I also found that I could produce high quality documents in less than two-thirds of the time I could using any other software. LyX 2 now has all the writing tools a writer could need, offers a choice of ways for a group to write collaboratively and can produce the final output in print, PDF or HTML format.

But LyX 1 did not handle multiple languages well and here [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/) came to my aid; it has now morphed into [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/download). Not only does it support more languages than any other similar program, it makes it very easy to switch languages and to spell-check in multiple languages. If you are familiar with MS Office 2003, LibreOffice will be reassuringly familiar; the main differences are that it can open documents in a wider range of formats and it uses a different database format from MS Access in which to store data, though there are ways to get round this.

My other early discovery was [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/), a comprehensive image manipulation program. ImageMagick can convert nearly every known format into another format and it can be set up to do repetitive operations, for example, converting a large number of images from one size to another. I use it because it is so quick and easy to use for simple conversions and cropping.

Most recently I have begun to use [Scribus](http://www.scribus.net/), another program developed by professionals who were dissatisfied with what commercial software had to offer. Scribus allows very fine control over the design of a poster or leaflet and, as well as simple printing, will produce colour separations for use with a professional quality printer along with PDFs.
