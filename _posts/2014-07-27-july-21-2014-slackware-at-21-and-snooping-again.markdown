**David S** celebrated Slackware’s 21st birthday with a [slide presentation](http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2014/07/27/files/slackware21-slides.odp) in which he pointed out that, among other things, it:






  * has maintained more of BSD’s traditions


  * continues to flourish without a major backer


  * is simple to install — all dependencies in the core distro have been satisfied


  * is compiled for reliability


  * has a Core Team, mostly of volunteers


  * has support provided by [LinuxQuestions.org](http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/forumdisplay.php?forumid=14)


  * has community repositories hosted on [SlackBuilds.org](http://slackbuilds.org/)


  * has a [documentation project](http://docs.slackware.com/).




He concluded by asking ‘21 years and still not tried it? What are you waiting for?’




After a request for an item on [Docker containers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) and a discussion of the current state of the software being used by [BCB](http://www.bcbradio.co.uk/) ...




**David S** took us on a tour of the documentation for the [JTRIG tools used by GCHQ](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/07/14/jtrig-tools-techniques/). Among the points he made were that:






  * they use [MediaWiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediawiki)


  * they use [TOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network))
	

  * if you put a lot of the tool names in the [urban dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/), you find they are extremely rude


  * they use [Microsoft Excel](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/) to deliver trojans to computers.
