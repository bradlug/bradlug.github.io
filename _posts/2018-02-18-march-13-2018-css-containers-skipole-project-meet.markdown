<p><strong>Darren</strong> brought a problem he had had with some wi-fi headphones but, after various attempts to find a solution, we concluded that there was a hardware compatibility problem.</p><p><strong>John</strong> thanked members for their contributions at the previous meeting to the GDPR presentation which had been well-accepted by non-geeks. He went on to highlight a number of changes to HTML and CSS. Ostensibly there had been very few changes to HTML — such as the removal of the &lt;keygen&gt; and &lt;menuitem&gt; elements — but the apparently superfluous &lt;main&gt; element which had been added four or five years earlier had been revealed as the foundation for some far reaching developments.</p><p>He recalled that, when Dave Fisher did his <a href="http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2010/08/17/august-25th-html5" type="text/html">presentation on HTML5</a> in 2010, he had drawn a diagram of the semantic elements:</p><img src="http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2018/03/18/images/HTML_page.png" width = "243" height = "183" alt="Header at top, nav, article and aside across middle, footer at bottom" role="img"><p>John had used this layout on the websites he had developed by using the CSS code:</p><p><code>nav {float: left; width: 19%; padding: 1em;}<br>aside {float: right; width: 19%; padding: 1em;}<br>article {margin-left: 22%; margin-right: 22%; padding: 1em;}</code></p><p>But, unless the &lt;article&gt; element is longer than both the &lt;nav&gt; and the &lt;aside&gt; elements, the &lt;footer&gt; element moves to one side, under the two shorter elements.</p><p>This problem had been elegantly solved by the arrival of the flex container in CSS.</p><p>Using the HTML structure:</p><p><code>&lt;body&gt;<br>&lt;header> … /&lt;header&gt;<br>&lt;main&gt;<br>&lt;article> … &lt;/article&gt;<br>&lt;nav> … &lt;/nav&gt;<br>&lt;aside … &lt;/aside&gt;<br>&lt;/main&gt;<br>&lt;footer> … &lt;/footer&gt;<br>&lt;body&gt;</code></p><p>and the CSS declarations:</p><p><code>main {display: flex;}<br>main &gt; article {order: 2; …}<br>main &gt; nav {order: 1; … }<br>main &gt; aside {order: 3; … }</code></p><p>the three elements are contained in the &lt;main&gt; element above the &lt;footer&gt; element and have equal height.</p><p>In fact, there are two new containers in CSS: the flex container which flexes in one dimension only and the grid container which reorganises its elements in two dimensions. For example, a grid container might contain eight elements which appear in two rows of four when viewed on a smartphone in landscape orientation but in four rows of two when viewed in portrait orientation. With a horizontal flex container, the elements would be wider in landscape format and narrower in portrait format but their disposition would not change.</p><p>A <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-flexbox-1/#propdef-flex" type="text/html">page in the CSS docs</a> illustrates the various layout possibilities with a flex container from all the elements expanding to fill all the space to sharing any spare space between the elements.</p><p>He showed the range of flex and grid attributes in <a href="https://johnrhudson.me.uk/computing/Some_notes_on_CSS.pdf" type="application/pdf">Some notes on CSS</a> along with the new mask attributes attributes for more complex colour schemes and the voice attributes for use with speech synthesisers. Finally, be mentioned the new <code>@counter-style</code> rule enabling the use of a wider range of custom styles in enumerated lists including the adaptation of existing list styles.</p><p><strong>Bernard</strong> introduced the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/skipole/skipole" type="text/html">Skipole Project</a>. <code>skipole.py</code> is a framework for creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface" type="text/html">Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI)</a> connections between web servers and Python applications. Among the available connections are:</p><ul><li>Apache <a href="https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/mod_wsgi" type="text/html"><code>mod_wsgi</code></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/Pylons/waitress" type="text/html">Waitress</a></li><li><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/uWSGI" type="text/html">uWSGI</a></li><li><a href="http://gunicorn.org/" type="text/html">Guncorn</a><li></ul><p>There are four main functions:</p><ol><li><code>start_project</code></li><li><code>start_call</code></li><li><code>submit_data</code></li><li><code>end_call</code></li></ol><p>These have access to a a dictionary of widgets and fieldnames. Pages which require user input are known as responders but the final output is either a &lt;template&gt; element or a JSON file.</p><p><code>skiadmin</code>, a web based interface, is available at <code>localhost:8000/skiadmin</code>.</p><p>He demonstrated how he had used the framework for the <a href="http://www.astronomycentre.org.uk/index.php/2-uncategorised/29-remscope" type="text/html">Remscope</a> at the Todmorden <a href="http://www.astronomycentre.org.uk/" type="text/html">Astronomy Centre</a>, a project he had shared at the <a href="http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2017/10/20/october-09-2017-mqtt-modx-civicrm-meet" type="text/html">9 October 2017</a> meeting.</p><p>For him, the advantage of using <code>skipole.py</code> is that it is controllable. Further information is available on the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/skipole/skipole/wiki/Home" type="text/html">Wiki</a>.</p>
