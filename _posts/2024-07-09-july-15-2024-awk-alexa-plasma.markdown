<p><strong>Brian</strong> commented that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nmap" type="text/html" role="link">nmap</a> is not working as it used to [as from 7.90, it changed its licence and is no longer considered free; the alternative would appear to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZMap_(software)" type="text/html" role="link">ZMap</a>].</p><p><strong>Darren</strong> is working on a demonstration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK" type="text/html" role="link">AWK</a>, the data extraction program. He demonstrated some examples of basic conditional printing and of combining patterns to achieve more sophisticated results.</p><p><strong>Brian</strong> uses Alexa a lot and was prompted by all the projects on <a href="https://www.hackster.io/search?i=projects&q=alexa raspberry pi" type="text/html" role="link">Hackster.io</a> to explore installing <a href="https://www.mymediaalexa.com/" type="text/html" role="link">myMedia</a> on a Raspberry Pi 2 running <a href="https://raspians.com/raspberry-pi-media-server/" type="text/html" role="link">Raspberry Pi Media Server</a> managing all his music; it had been a bit fiddly to set up but, after a week’s free trial, it costs £9 a year. He demonstrated issuing commands to Alexa to play different kinds of music.</p><p>He has also been using <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/connect/" type="text/html" role="link">Raspberry Pi Connect</a> which relies on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC" type="text/html" role="link">WebRTC</a> and requires <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(protocol)" type="text/html" role="link">Wayland</a>.</p><p><strong>Steve</strong> noted that there is a new version of <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/6/6.1.0/" type="text/html" role="link">Plasma</a>, which includes a remote desktop, which led into a discussion of the various ways of updating distributions — some updates require you to install programs manually; Arch uses source files while openSUSE offers both an update which installs the system but where you add programs manually and a console based script which updates the system and all installed programs at once.</p><p>The remote desktop in Plasma 6.1 will be a great addition as the Microsoft <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients" type="text/html" role="link">remote desktop</a> relies on its own technology.</p><p>Steve is also going to have a look at <a href="https://www.truenas.com/" type="text/html" role="link">TrueNAS</a>.</p>
