<p><strong>Brian</strong> described how he had reflashed his smartphone and his tablet. With the demise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyanogenMod" type="text/html">CyanogenMod</a>, <a href="https://www.lineageos.org/" type="text/html">LineageOS</a> has taken taken over this space. First go to the <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/" type="text/html">Wiki</a> and find the codename for your device; then click on that for the instructions for your device. Note that these are overcomplicated and many steps can be ignored.</p><p>Go to <a href="http://opengapps.org/" type="text/html">OpenGApps</a> where you need to locate your Android version and your processor. You can also choose the level of Google service you want from minimal to maximum. Download the relevant <code>zip</code> file to your computer.</p><p>If they are not already installed, install <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html" type="text/html">adb</a> on your computer and <a href="https://twrp.me/Devices/" type="text/html">TWRP</a> on your device. Enable USB debugging on your device and also allow installation from unknown devices. If necessary, unlock your device (advice on doing this using <code>adb</code> is on the Wiki). Copy the LineageOS <code>zip</code> file relevant to your device along with the <code>zip</code> file from OpenGApps onto your <code>sdcard</code>. Then press the recommended keys such as Volume up and Power to enter recovery mode. You will see an option to Wipe; select this and then Advanced Wipe. Select Cache, System and Data partitions to be wiped and then Swipe to Wipe. Then go back and select Install, locate the <code>zip</code> files on the <code>sdcard</code> and install the new system and the Google apps. Then reboot.</p><p>Brian had had to change the launcher on his device but the only frustration he had experienced is that <a href="https://telegram.org/" type="text/html">Telegram</a> needs to be launched to work whereas <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/" type="text/html">WhatsApp</a> does not.</p><p>He has also installed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSipSimple" type="text/html">CSipSimple</a> to integrate all his communications.</p><p>Note that you will be installing a nightly update but he had experienced no problems with this. Also firmware updates come through.</p><p><strong>David S</strong> introduced us to <a href="http://classicprogrammerpaintings.com/" type="text/html">Classic Programmer Paintings</a>. Scroll down towards the bottom for the abandoned GitHub repository.</p><p><strong>Tony</strong> recommended using <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" type="text/html">Let’s Encrypt</a> for security certificates. It is managed on the command line by installing <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/" type="text/html">Certbot</a> and all you need is the sort of information you need when registering a domain.</p>
