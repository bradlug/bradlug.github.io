<p><strong>John</strong> shared a <a href="http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2018/02/18/files/GDPR.odp" type="application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.presentation">presentation</a> he was developing on GDPR for small voluntary organisations. David S commented that the test for organisations would be ‘have you made a <i lang="la">bona fide</i> attempt to meet the regulations?’ He also commented on the three different uses of ‘loss’:</p><ul><li>loss of data by deletion</li><li>loss of data by theft, and</li><li>loss (harm) to someone as a result of either of the first two.</li></ul><p>For organisations managing their own servers, they might need to consider encrypting the server logs; however, small voluntary organisations which use a server are more likely to use a hosted server.</p><p>Suggested software:</p><ul><li><a href="https://keybase.io/" type="text/html">Keybase</a>: it works like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropbox_(service)" type="text/html">Dropbox</a> setting up shared folders which can be accessed only by certain people. No data is passed to Keybase; only the links to the folders to allow sharing.</li><li><a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/" type="text/html">WhatsApp</a>, a secure messaging service, now owned by Facebook, might be suitable for some organisations but would need checking for its suitability.</li><li><a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html" type="text/html">VeraCrypt</a> allows you to encrypt parts of hard drives; it is probably most suited to office based systems.</li><li><a href="https://vgough.github.io/encfs" type="text/html">EncFS</a> provides an encrypted filesystem in userspace.</li><li><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/thunderbird/" type="text/html">Thunderbird</a> allows you to encrypt emails; however you need a program like <a href="https://gnupg.org/" type="text/html">GnuPG</a> to provide the encryption keys.</li></ul><p>Never transfer anything on USB sticks.</p><p><strong>Darren</strong> spoke about the last <a href="http://leedscodedojo.github.io/" type="text/html">Leeds Code Dojo</a> when they had taken part in <a href="https://www.codewars.com/" type="text/html">codewars</a>, each writing a program in a chosen language to solve a problem. When you submit your program, it is evaluated to provide you with a review and a ranking as a coder.</p><p><strong>David S</strong> drew attention to <code><a href="https://github.com/speed47/spectre-meltdown-checker/" type="text/html">spectre-meltdown-checker.sh</a></code> which checks how many vulnerabilities have been addressed in your kernel.</p><p>Intel had originally sent out a patch which had allegedly caused some machines to freeze; so it had withdrawn it and then discovered that it did not necessarily freeze machines and reissued it.</p><p>The latest updates from Intel are available as <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/02/microcode-update-guidance.pdf" type="application/pdf">Microcode Revision Guidance</a>.</p><p><a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2018-02-09/kpti-kaiser-meltdown-performance.html" type="text/html">Brendan Gregg</a> has done a paper on Initial Performance Regressions as a result of KPTI/KAISER Meltdown.</p>
