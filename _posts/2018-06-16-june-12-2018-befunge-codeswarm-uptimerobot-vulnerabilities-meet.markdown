<p><strong>Darren</strong>shared his experiences at the June <a href="https://leedscodedojo.github.io/" type="text/html">Leeds Code Dojo</a> meeting when the programming challenge was to write a parser for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befunge" type="text/html">Befunge</a> whose code is written on a two dimensional grid and uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation" type="text/html">Reverse Polish Notation</a>. Befunge was originally written to be as hard to compile as possible though compilers do exist for it. He showed the parser he had written in <a href="https://dlang.org/" type="text/html">D</a>.</p><p>You can only input numerals from 0–9 and so higher values need to be calculated from these values.</p><p><strong>Bernard</strong> commented that <a href="https://pymotw.com/2/shlex/" type="text/html">Python Shlex</a> is a parser for languages that use the shell.</p><p><strong>Mike</strong> asked if anyone could recommend stock trading software. A quick Google search suggested that <a href="https://jstock.org/" type="text/html">JStock</a> might be his best option but there are others.</p><p><strong>Bernard</strong> mentioned <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/" type="text/html">Python Anywhere</a> which allows you to code in Python anywhere and the <a href="https://vimeo.com/1093745" type="text/html">Python Code Swarm</a> which provides a visualisation of commits to Python over the first fourteen years of its existence. There are others, for example, of <a href="https://vimeo.com/1130828" type="text/html">Eclipse</a>.</p><p><strong>David S</strong> introduced us to <a href="https://uptimerobot.com/" type="text/html">Uptime Robot</a> which pings servers at predefined intervals and tells you if things are up or down — essential for keeping track of when Virgin Media is down at BCB.</p><p>He went on to share a couple of projects. He has written a Python program to track the work of <a href="http://slackbuilds.org/" type="text/html">Slackbuilds</a> contributors and is thinking about one to track vulnerabilities. He needs a way of collating who has been active on Slackbuilds and when and what they have done. By comparing their Git history with data from <a href="https://repology.org/" type="text/html">Repology</a>, he can find out what percentage of packages are up-to-date and what percentage are the newest packages.</p><p>Tracking vulnerabilities in packages is more difficult as there is no centralised vulnerabilities list for Linux. <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/" type="text/html">FreeBSD</a> uses <a href="https://www.vuxml.org/" type="text/html">VuXML</a> which hasn’t been updated since 2005; the <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/" type="text/html">National Vulnerability Database</a> uses <a href="https://github.com/clearlinux/cve-check-tool" type="text/html">cve-check-tool</a> which has no way of downloading just updates and so you end up downloading everything each time; <a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/" type="text/html">pkgsrc</a> for <a href="https://www.netbsd.org/" type="text/html">NetBSD</a> provides everything you need in a CSV file except that the first field combines the name of the software with its version in a way which makes it extremely difficult to parse by version.</p><p>Finally, David reported that there is a bug in Ubuntu 18.4 which makes it impossible to install on some devices, including ones with bog standard Intel graphics, because there is no way to open a virtual console to address the problem when it occurs.</p>
