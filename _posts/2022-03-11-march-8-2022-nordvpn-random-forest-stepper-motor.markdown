<p><strong>Brian</strong> said he had gone back to using a PBX as the interface for cordless ’phones and his mobile. The mobile connects via Bluetooth but the audio quality is poor.</p><p>He had discovered that the Raspberry Pi 2 is the minimum on which you can use <a href="https://nordvpn.com/" type="text/html" role="link">NordVPN</a> with which he is using the Raspberry Pi as a gateway.</p><blockquote><p><code>NordVPN Raspberry Pi Gateway Setup<br>==================================</code></p><p><code>Created Sunday 05 July 2020<br>+Install NordVPN App on Debian Linux</code></p><p><code>To allow packet forwarding<br>In  /etc/sysctl.conf  uncomment the line:</code></p><p><code>net.ipv4.ip_forward=1</code></p><p><code>Then run this script</code></p><p><code>sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o nordlynx -j MASQUERADE<br>sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o nordlynx -j ACCEPT<br>sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i nordlynx -o eth0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT<br>sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT<br>sudo iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p icmp -j ACCEPT<br>sudo iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT<br>sudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT<br>sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP<br>sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP<br>sudo iptables -L<br>sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent<br>sudo systemctl enable netfilter-persistent</code></p><p><code>│ Current iptables rules can be saved to the configuration file /etc/iptables/rules.v4.

You train the autoencoder, which works like a compression rather than an encryption program, on files to produce a signature in the form of a small array. But how do you compare these signatures? You need to train both the encoder and the decoder at same time. In the end, a very compressed signature is useful for comparisons.</p><p>Darren wondered if people could think of any bloopers which might throw light on what to beware of.</p><p>He is also using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest" type="text/html" role="link">Random forest</a> decision trees to study how neurons decide how to connect themselves.</p><p>He also mentioned that he had a problem with errors on a WD rotational hard drive? David wondered if it was a USB cable problem or vibration from a nearby speaker or just a bad hard drive.</p><p>David suggested he used <a href="https://www.smartmontools.org/" type="text/html" role="link">smart</a>, noting that there are very few rotating hard drive manufacturers and their reputations tend to go up and down. With SSDs the problem is counterfeits.</p><p>In response to a question about the IT community’s involvement in Ukraine,</p><p><strong>Bernard</strong> said that there were a lot of Python developers from Ukraine and the community was helping a family to get out. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(hacker_group)" type="text/html" role="link">Anonymous</a> is said to be helping while the BBC has enabled <a href="https://www.torproject.org/" type="text/html" role="link">Tor</a> on its website; Brian mentioned that the BBC is using short wave.</p><p>Bernard demonstrated the stepper motor being controlled by the Raspberry Pi Pico; he can make the stepper motor go at any rate by programming it, in his case, with a Python file. He had bought all the bits separately and now needs to attach it to the camera base.</p><p>He added that they are selling the chip in the Pico on its own for people who think they can handle it and David said there are Youtube videos to tell you how to do it.</p><p>Brian asked how he programmed it and Bernard said he connected via the USB to download the files; the Pico has lots of different inputs making it suitable for use as a micro-controller. He uses <a href="https://micropython.org/" type="text/html" role="link">MicroPython</a> which is a subset of Python but with extra libraries to control hardware. Brian asked whether he needed to install anything and Bernard said you have to load the MicroPython interpreter first as with other languages.</p><p>If you want a Python web server, there is <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" type="text/html" role="link">Django</a>, among others.</p><p><strong>Brian</strong> shared the following code:</p><blockquote><p><code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code></p><p><code>### Using Python HttpServer as a simple HTTP Server For python vesion 3 (Check version python -V) Command: python -m http.server 9000 https://www.askpython.com/python-modules/python-httpserver</code></p><p><code>#### Executing linux commands from a web page https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/programming-9/executing-linux-commands-from-web-page-and-outputing-it-back-to-the-web-page-724581/</code></p></blockquote><p>Bernard commented that <code>-m</code> runs a script which in this case creates a sample server; Brian said he only wanted something to put on his local server and Bernard suggested <a href="https://cherrypy.dev/" type="text/html" role="link">CherryPy</a> which can call an <code>exec</code> program if needed but, as Brian is more familiar with PHP, he should use that instead.</p><p>David asked when Bernard would be able to share some pictures taken using the stepper motor and Bernard said, ‘When it is finished and there is a really dark night.’ There are still a lot of practical things to get right.</p><p><strong>David</strong> reported that BCB has opened its building just like the old days.</p><p>Anonymous has leaked documents telling <code>ru</code> sites to repatriate everything suggesting that the Russian government is preparing to cut itself off from the Internet; also the Russian cable snipping ship has launched.</p><p>Finally, he shared a Youtube video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N65DpT2nqEI" type="text/html" role="link">Scavenging rechargeable lithium cells from the roadside</a>.</p>
