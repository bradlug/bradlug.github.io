<p>As no-one had prepared anything specific for the meeting, the conversation wandered over a wide range of computing and non-computing topics.</p><p><strong>Brian</strong> demonstrated how you can use the KDE Wallpaper settings</p><figure><img src="http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2020/12/08/images/Folder_view_settings.png" width = "584" height = "252" alt="Folder View/Picture of the Day/Bing/Scaled and Cropped" role="img"></figure><p>to access the Bing Picture of the Day:</p><figure><img sizes="49vw" srcset="http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2020/12/08/images/Picture_of_the_day_400px.png 400w, http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2020/12/08/images/Picture_of_the_day_800px.png 800w, http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2020/12/08/images/Picture_of_the_day_1200px.png 1200w, http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2020/12/08/images/Picture_of_the_day_1600px.png 1600w" src="http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2020/12/08/images/Picture_of_the_day_400px.png" alt="Canal junction cityscape" role="img"></figure><p>He also mentioned that Windows mobile ’phones are prized by asylum seekers because it is safe to contact their families because people don’t hack Windows ’phones.</p><p><strong>John</strong> demonstrated <a href="https://kdenlive.org/en/" type="text/html" role="link">Kdenlive</a> which he had been using to create online material during the pandemic. He had initially found it confusing because it was not self-evident that you had to select <code>Project->Add clip</code> before you could do anything. Brian commented that he had had a similar problem when he started to use <a href="https://nodered.org/" type="text/html" role="link">Node-RED</a>.</p><p>John demonstrated moving a clip to the main editing channels, cutting it and removing a section. Through manipulating the clips graphically, you in effect create a script which you ultimately ask Kdenlive to use to render the video. Kdenlive accepts clips in almost any format and it is best to set the main editing channels to the highest resolution you intend to use. Then you can select <code>mp4</code> or <code>webm</code> for high resolution output, for example, to put a video on Youtube. You can create DVDs by the selecting the Old TV/DVD option which creates videos at 720×576 resolution. There is a Custom DVD format but this does not create videos which will play on older/more basic DVD players.</p><p><strong>Brian</strong> mentioned that, having become frustrated with the <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/" type="text/html" role="link">Apache</a> directory listings, he had download <a href="https://www.nginx.com/" type="text/html" role="link">Nginx</a> and found it no less frustrating.</p><p>Thereafter the conversation drifted off into Brian’s neighbours, the contents of his snack and sourdough starter hotels (search the Internet) until Brian brought the conversation back to <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/wave-share" type="text/html" role="link">wave-share</a>, a proof-of-concept for linking computers wirelessly using WebRTC browsers and sound.</p><p>He then shared a screenshot of an extract from <code>default-ssl.conf</code> which he had used to set up a reverse proxy for his AWS server:</p><figure><img src="http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2020/12/08/images/Reverse_proxy.png" width = "444" height = "255" alt="Code to set up reverse proxy" role="img"></figure><p><strong>David</strong> asked about the use of <code>ip4</code> and suggested Brian enter</p><blockquote><code>netstat -pant</code></blockquote><p>with revealed that Brian was in fact using <code>ip6</code>.</p><p>David also asked about using <a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/" type="text/html" role="link">Tasmota</a> from the command line and Brian later came back with the answer that, assuming you are operating a <a href="https://mqtt.org/" type="text/html" role="link">MQTT</a> broker, such as <a href="http://mosquitto.org/" type="text/html" role="link">Mosquitto</a>, you can just use MQTT commands.</p><p>Thereafter the conversation drifted into more general topics such as wi-fi availability, electrical connections, Brexit, Covid-19 and the vaccine rollout with brief excursions into <a href="https://b4rn.org.uk/" type="text/html" role="link">B4RN</a>, which offers Gigabit Ethernet to rural households in the north of England, <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" type="text/html" role="link">Wireguard</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubi" type="text/html" role="link">Tubi</a>, which currently requires a US location permanently to access its material, and whether <a href="https://web.whatsapp.com/" type="text/html" role="link">WhatsApp web</a> provided the same level of security as using WhatsApp between two mobile ’phones — the jury was out on this one.</p>
