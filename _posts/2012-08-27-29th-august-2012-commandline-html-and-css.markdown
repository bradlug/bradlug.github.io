David pointed out that in Unix everything is either an operation or something being operated on.
The things being operated on are files in the filesystem which he pointed out resembles the humble potato. Files only contain streams of bytes and programs can usually work out what each file does regardless of its name.
We can operate on files using the GNU coreutils.

Alice and John summarised the developments in HTML, CSS and associated technologies over the past year and demonstrated the progress in implementing the new input types - which has been greater on mobile 'phones than on desktops.
