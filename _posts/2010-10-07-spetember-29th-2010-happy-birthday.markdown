The meeting on the 29th gave a chance to look to both the past and the future. See [Andrea's post](http://bradlug.co.uk/?p=552) for the pre-meeting agenda.

Quite a lot of things came out of the meeting, and if thoughts, suggestions and ideas are to be taken forward then people are welcome to get cracking on them.

Attached we have John's presentation that was amended as the meeting progressed and a PDF of the post-it comments that people made. (svg file also available - please [contact us](http://bradlug.co.uk/?page_id=20) if you want it.).

  * [Second Birthday Presentation](http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2010/10/07/files/Second_birthday_discussion.pdf)


Some of the things in the PDF's are reproduced below. There was discussion on some of the points below, but if anyone would like to follow some of them through (RB may be mounting a coup if anyone is interested!), then posting here, the [forum](http://bradlug.proboards.com/) or the mailing list would be good.

**Likes (John)**



	
  * Runs without a committee/bureaucracy

	
  * Diverse membership and participation

	
  * Wide range of topics covered

	
  * Opportunities for smaller groups to do own thing


**Likes (group)**



	
  * It's cheap, it's regular

	
  * Truly interesting people, no pretentiousness

	
  * 100% fab

	
  * Like the talks, different perspectives

	
  * Cake is good/more talks

	
  * More talks/more guests/more show and tell/more competitions


**Dislikes (1)**



	
  * Haven't taken over the world yet

	
  * Do we want a plan for world domination or are we happy as a clique of awesome friends?

	
  * This pen is rubbish

	
  * Are we running out of ideas for talks?


**Dislikes (2)**



	
  * Lack of local business support/awareness

	
  * Less postit notes

	
  * Temperature of room

	
  * Talks too webtech, rather than Linux based

	
  * Lack of collaborative work


**Other**



	
  * New dictator RB

	
  * Unified agreed method of communication

	
  * Free room

	
  * Hardware/Arduino day

	
  * Ways of inducting newcomers into the group


**Meetings (John)**



	
  * Regular monthly meeting a useful anchor

	
  * No reason not to have lots of different meetings to suit different interests

	
  * Would only attend occasional ones beyond monthly meeting because of other commitments

	
  * Happy to contribute to/participate in tutorials/workshops


**Meetings (group)**



	
  * Regular monthly meeting plus mid monthly meeting for other talks/projects

	
  * A way to reimburse external speakers' costs and to invite more

	
  * People say what they have been doing in past month, what OS they favour and why

	
  * Talks split into talks and demos

	
  * More external speakers
