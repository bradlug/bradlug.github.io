<p><strong>David</strong> had set up <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/" type="text/html" role="link">Home Assistant</a> in a <a href="https://www.docker.com/" type="text/html" role="link">Docker</a> container. There are <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/" type="text/html" role="link">four ways to install Home Assistant</a>:</p><ul><li>an image, for example on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" type="text/html" role="link">Raspberry Pi</a> but that cannot be changed;</li><li>a Docker image;</li><li>installation of the Supervisor on <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/" type="text/html" role="link">Debian Buster</a> which can be changed;</li><li>using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" type="text/html" role="link">Python venv</a>.</li></ul><p>David had chosen the Docker container because it doesn’t involve a new OS though Brian argued for the principle: one computer, one job — one reason why he has about 13 Raspberry Pis.</p><figure><img src="http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2021/05/11/images/Home_assistant_Brian.png" width = "500" height = "227" alt="Display of Home Assistant Control Panel" role="img"></figure><p>Brian had set up an LXC container with Firefox and then tried to <code>ssh</code> into the container. He put up his control panel.</p><figure><img src="http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2021/05/11/images/Home_assistant_David.png" width = "500" height = "250" alt="Display of Home Assistant Control Panel" role="img"></figure><p>David put up his control panel, commenting that each had everything the other did not and that, using the Integration feature, it had found his router.</p><p>He shared some of the graphs it generated and went on to say that he was hoping to link it to his 3D printer to show the temperatures and the scheduling of the print. He also plans to link it to <a href="https://www.deluge-torrent.org/" type="text/html" role="link">Deluge</a>.</p><p>Brian commented that using a VPN prevents people from detecting a torrent; David commented that he has got <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" type="text/html" role="link">WireGuard</a>.</p><p>Brian added that he plans to link the particulate detector to Home Assistant to turn on the fan and also to the air filter.</p><p><strong>Brian</strong> said that he had been surprised at how well <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/" type="text/html" role="link">Bluetooth</a> worked over a distance and went for a walk around his flat to show all the devices which he had connected and the distance.</p><p><strong>Bernard</strong> shared four more hedgehog clips showing hedgehogs fighting over access to the food; where one rolled in a ball the other would roll it away.</p><p><strong>David</strong> then attempted some remote assistance to John W who was getting an error message every time he tried to upgrade from <a href="https://xubuntu.org/news/xubuntu-18-04-release/" type="text/html" role="link">Xubuntu 18.4</a> to <a href="https://xubuntu.org/news/xubuntu-20-04-released/" type="text/html" role="link">Xubuntu 20.4</a>. After trying a range of options including:</p><p><code>apt autoremove<br>apt clean<br>apt dist-upgrade</code></p><p>and</p><p><code>do-release-upgrade</code></p><p>among others, all of which ended up with the same error, David guided John in sending over the logs which revealed that there were irreconcilable python conflicts. So the only solution would appear to be reinstallation.</p><p><strong>Darren</strong> entertained us with a new <a href="https://jitsi.org/blog/march-update-new-toolbar-ui-virtual-backgrounds-and-more/" type="text/html" role="link">Jitsi background</a> after which Bernard and John W joined in.<p>
