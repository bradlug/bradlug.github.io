<p>For the first of our new style online meetings, Bernie, Darren and John started on <a href="https://discord.com/" type="text/html" role="link">Discord</a> while Steve and Mike started on <a href="https://meet.calyx.net/" type="text/html" role="link">Calyx meet</a> before we all moved to Calyx meet where we were joined by David and John W.</p><p><strong>Mike</strong> has had a problem with sound disappearing; John suggested that he use <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/" type="text/html" role="link">PulseAudio</a> to diagnose which sound sources are recognised and whether any have been muted. Mike has also had a problem with <a href="https://www.darktable.org/" type="text/html" role="link">darktable</a> and has been told he needs to get a coredump. But for that he needs the devel files and to compile darktable with <code>-g</code> set. Steve looked up the source on <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable" type="text/html" role="link">github</a> which provides all the information about how to build darktable.</p><p>John wondered whether he could do what he wants with <a href="https://www.digikam.org/" type="text/html" role="link">digiKam</a> as it is build on darktable; however David commented that digiKam is bloated.</p><p><strong>David</strong> mentioned his surprise at being name checked in <a href="https://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2023/272/Custom-Slackware-Repository" type="text/html" role="link">Linux Magazine</a> over <code>slackrepo</code>.</p><p><strong>Bernie</strong> demonstrated the Raspberry Pi 5 which he had bought from the <a href="https://events.raspberrypi.com/official/863a4db2-0c66-4ba3-98c5-cc0b99594a82" type="text/html" role="link">Raspberry Pi Store</a> in the Victoria Centre, Leeds, showing the home screen through TigerVNC.</p><figure><img src="http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2023/12/12/images/Pi_TigerVNC.png" alt="Image of Chinese cormorant fisherman with lanterns on a blue background" width="500" height="293" role="img"><figcaption>Pi desktop via TigerVNC</figcaption></figure><p>He commented that 5amps is needed to use USB ports but in practice the power supply negotiates the amperage. David commented that his Pi 4 has four USBs running on it. Bernie added that it can run two cameras.</p><figure><img src="http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2023/12/12/images/Pi_5.png" alt="Components of Raspberry Pi 5" width="500" height="372" role="img"><figcaption>Pi 5</figcaption></figure><p>You do not need to buy a fan and the fan only comes on when you need it. Steve added that the cooler fan is totally silent.</p><figure><img src="http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2023/12/12/images/Cooling.png" alt="Cooling unit on top of Pi 5 board" width="500" height="381" role="img"><figcaption>Cooling unit</figcaption></figure><p>Bernie said that it needs a reasonably fast SD card; the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi-5.html" type="text/html" role="link">specs</a> include an 8GB option and the documentation recommends using a rechargeable battery. David asked about the CPU and Bernie said it was about twice as fast as in the Pi 4. Steve noted that the Pi 5 supports AES. David said that he understood that H265 was not present and Bernie said that video handling was being done in software rather than in hardware.</p><p>Bernie noted that the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/" type="text/html" role="link">Raspberry Pi Zero</a> is back in stock.</p><p><strong>Steve</strong> shared an example of using the Pi Zero and MQTT which he had originally been inspired to investigate by Brian’s 2016 presentation on <a href="https://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2016/09/16/september-12-2016-mqtt-node-red-micro-benchmarks-and-review-of-the-year" type="text/html" role="link">Node-RED and MQTT</a>.</p><figure><img src="http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2023/12/12/images/Steve.png" alt="Steve holding up a display unit" width="361" height="256" role="img"><figcaption>Steve’s example of using MQTT with a Pi Zero</figcaption></figure><p>There was a discussion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_(package_manager)|" type="text/html" role="link">Snaps</a> which Ubuntu installs rather than downloading the program from a repo.</p><p><strong>David</strong> commented that <a href="https://appimage.org/" type="text/html" role="link">AppImages</a> work like a charm; though all the libraries are linked to a particular version of Ubuntu, they work nearly always and, when they don’t, it’s fixed within a couple of weeks.</p><p><strong>Steve</strong> commented that he is running <a href="https://www.releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/" type="text/html" role="link">Ubuntu 22.04 LTS</a> which he finds very stable.</p><p><strong>Darren</strong> reported that his microphone had stopped working after he had tried to adjust it with Alsa.</p><p>He is going to the <a href="https://www.keepingdigital.org.uk/digital-making/york-coderdojo/" type="text/html" role="link">York CoderDojo</a> where he uses <a href="https://dlang.org/" type="text/html" role="link">D</a>; it takes a long time to compile but runs very fast. However, macros are very difficult to introduce. This led into a discussion of macros; Steve said that he did not like the C macros while David commented that macros were a stupid idea in a high level language; they were a bad idea 49 years ago and are a bad idea now. Darren defended the use of macros but David said that you cannot use macros in other contexts. Macros may be useful for doing functions in a scripting system but they should not be used for type definitions.</p><p>Darren commented that he found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" type="text/html" role="link">Java</a> easier to use than <a href="https://www.python.org/" type="text/html" role="link">Python</a>; he likes D for much the same reason.</p>
