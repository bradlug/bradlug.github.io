**John H** summarised [his experiences](http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2014/08/20/files/Introduction_to_Linux.odp) of the Linux Foundation LFSx101: Introduction to Linux course.




**David C** reminded people not to forget that the function keys on their devices sometimes control whether hardware is or is not available for use.




**Brian** warned people that the permissions relating to SD cards have changed in [KitKat](http://www.android.com/kitkat/).




**David C** reported that Donna Johnson, Head of Learning and Participation at National Media Museum, has been in touch about doing something at the Media Museum. David had invited her to join us for a pizza before the meeting, at the meeting or in the pub after the meeting to explore ideas.




It was suggested that she might get in touch with Ben Nuttall to talk about his experiences on his [USA Tour](http://www.raspberrypi.org/tag/ben-nuttall/).




**John H** did a [review of Georgina Ferry‘s book](http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2014/08/20/files/Computer_called_LEO.odp) A computer called LEO about how J. Lyons & Co. became involved in the creation of the first business computer.




**David S** rounded the meeting off with an update on the latest developments in the snooping revelations, including:






  * GCHQ is using [nmap](http://nmap.org/) to port scan entire countries using geolocated IP lists


  * GCHQ is building up botnets AKA ‘Operational Relay Boxes’; its programme entails:


    * Reconnaisance


    * Infection


    * Command and control


    * Exfiltration

			





In answer to a question, he said that the selection of material to publish had been made by the journalists with some help from [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/).
