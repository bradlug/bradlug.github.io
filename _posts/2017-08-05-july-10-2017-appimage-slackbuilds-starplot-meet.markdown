<p><strong>Brian</strong> introduced <a href="http://appimage.org/" type="text/html">AppImage</a> which provides a way of installing packages directly from the maintainer without going through a distro. Unfortunately,</p><ul><li>it doesn’t tell you what the packages do</li><li>there is no description on <a href="https://github.com/" type="text/html">GitHub</a> and</li><li>looking them up in Google may be no more revealing.</li></ul><p>There is a video on the <a href="http://appimage.org/" type="text/html">AppImage</a> page showing you how to install them.</p><p>The list of available images is on <a href="https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/AppImages" type="text/html">GitHub</a>; most are from maintainers but a few are provided by third parties.</p><p>John H commented that they would only be available to a single user, much like ‘foreign’ programs on a Mac while Alice commented that the advantage for maintainers was that they could package once for all distributions.</p><p>Brian mentioned that he had found <a href="https://github.com/ozmartian/vidcutter/releases/" type="text/html">VidCutter</a>, both <a href="https://www.keepassx.org/" type="text/html">KeePassX</a> and <a href="https://keepassxc.org/" type="text/html">KeePassXC</a>, the fork of KeePassX, and <a href="http://www.openbuilds.com/projectresources/laserweb-laser-controller-software.191/" type="text/html">LaserWeb</a> which he presumed was for driving laser cutting machines.</p><p><strong>David S</strong> was by then bursting to share <a href="http://pkgsrc.org/pkgsrcCon/2017/talks.html" type="text/html">his talk</a> at the <a href="http://pkgsrc.org/pkgsrcCon/2017/" type="text/html">NetBSD pkgsrc</a> conference in London on 1 July 2017 (download the <a href="http://pkgsrc.org/pkgsrcCon/2017/slides/sbo-at-pkgsrccon.pdf" type="application/pdf">slides</a>). <a href="http://netbsd.org/" type="text/html">NetBSD</a> had developed its own packaging system which has been ported to most Unices.</p><p>Among the points he made were:</p><ul><li><a href="http://slackbuilds.org/" type="text/html">SlackBuilds</a> deals with the non-core packages in <a href="http://www.slackware.com/index.php" type="text/html">Slackware</a></li><li>it has no bugtracker; you just contact the maintainer</li><li>it uses sympathetic maintainer reviews to encourage contributions</li><li>it attracts systemd refugees</li><li>always check <a href="https://repology.org/" type="text/html">Repology</a> for how up-to-date packages are</li><li>allow users to help each other</li><li>package obscure packages.</li></ul><p>Brian asked about <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" type="text/html">npm</a> with which he had had a lot of problems from inconsistent versions and Alice advised always installing from the package and not from the distro.</p><p>In reviewing the range of the package installers, David argued that the future is AppImage, <a href="http://flatpak.org/" type="text/html">Flatpak</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snappy_(package_manager)" type="text/html">Snappy</a> but he concluded that packaging involves applying standards to software so that it is ‘useful, usable and in use,’ something which none of the new package installers achieve.</p><p><strong>Q&A</strong> In Q&A, David commented that not all packages are built on clean systems. <a href="http://appimage.org/" type="text/html">AppImage</a> is not, as it claims, free of dependencies nor can it be trusted because packages are not signed and everything it achieves is no more than what could be achieved on Microsoft Windows.</p><p>On the other hand, <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/" type="text/html">LibreOffice</a> has long been looking for a way to avoid going through the distros.</p><p>Flatpak does extend its tentacles into the OS but he recommends it, not least because it has no systemd dependencies!</p><p><strong>Bernard</strong> then demonstrated <a href="http://old-dos.ru/index.php?page=files&mode=files&do=show&id=3188" type="text/html">StarPlot</a>, a starchart and plotting program which he had written in C in 1993 and which he had found again on a Russian ‘Abandonware’ site. He had had to write everything including the cursors in C though he had also licensed some libraries from Jeffrey Sax.</p><p>He was able to demonstrate it by using <a href="http://www.freedos.org/" type="text/html">FreeDOS</a> running in <a href="http://www.qemu.org/" type="text/html">QEMU</a>.</p><p>He had had to copy most of the data from books which will all be out of date in 50 years time. Part of the challenge is that the stars are moving relative to the sun which the earth is circling while also being wobbled by the moon. The Hubble telescope uses the technique of focusing on the bright stars to ensure that it remains in the correct orientation.</p><p>The program allows you to zoom in and out, to study comets or planets, among other things, and to modify the icons if desired.</p><p><strong>David S</strong> asked about <a href="https://www.packer.io/" type="text/html">Packer</a> and Alice said it is frequently used to build images to run on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" type="text/html">Amazon Web Services</a>.</p><p><strong>Brian</strong> wondered how we could attract more people to the group, perhaps by starting a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/" type="text/html">Meetup</a> group, but John H said that, in the past, we had attracted most people when had some sort of event with a speaker. Among suggestions were an event about installing <a href="https://www.raspbian.org/" type="text/html">Raspbian</a> on a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" type="text/html">Raspberry Pi</a> or a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/jam/" type="text/html">Raspberry Jam</a> but it was important to think of events that would benefit the attenders.</p><p>For the next meeting Brian hopes to be able to share his project to turn a clock radio into an Internet clock radio using <a href="http://nodered.org/" type="text/html">Node-RED</a> and incorporating text to speech so that it announces the station which it is broadcasting.</p>
