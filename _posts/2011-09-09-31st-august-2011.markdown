**David Spencer** presented [Darktable](http://darktable.sourceforge.net/), which does similar things to [DigiKam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiKam),
[Shotwell](http://yorba.org/shotwell/) and [F-Spot](http://f-spot.org/) but generally does them better. Its key feature is that
the original photos remain untouched; instead Darktable manipulates a history
stack of changes, including changes to the metadata, which can then be
exported elsewhere.

If it knows the lens – which it can detect from the EXIF data – it can do
barrel correction. It also applies the transformations in the right order
whatever the order they are in the history.

A manual is available from [http://api.ge.tt/0/2OZkBP1/2/blob/download](http://api.ge.tt/0/2OZkBP1/2/blob/download)

**Alice Kaerast** demonstrated using the HTML5 geolocation API to show the
location of bus stops. The data needed is available but not in consistent
formats.

**Steve Kerr** showed the new Gnome 3 interface

**John Hudson** shared some notes on HTML5 which he had put together and on which
he asked for feedback.
