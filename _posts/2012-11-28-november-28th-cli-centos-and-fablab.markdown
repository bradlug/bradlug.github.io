<strong>David C</strong> gave us a photographic tour of Airedale [Fab Lab](http://www.centreofmanufacturingexcellence.com/fab-lab/) and suggested that we should organise a trip there one Saturday.

<strong>Alice</strong> introduced us to CentOS QA testing of the coreutils using BASH scripts and <strong>Brian</strong> spoke about the Raspberry Pi Hack Weekend on 1/2 December.

<strong>John H</strong> reported on the meeting five of us had had with BCB earlier in the afternoon and we agreed to try and put together a half hour programme on IT for BCB to fill the slot left by the departure of their ICT Support Worker.

Then for each instance of a variable, <strong>David C</strong> showed us how to handle it in and command line. (Slides to follow).
