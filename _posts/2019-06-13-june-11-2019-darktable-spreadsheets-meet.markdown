<p><strong>Mike</strong> left the explanation of how to configure a server to allow a single IP address to serve four domains, each configured as a subdomain on the server, until next month when Brian will be back and gave a presentation on <a href="https://www.darktable.org/" type="text/html" role="link">darktable</a>. He illustrated a variety of effects, how you can organise the right hand pane to reflect your personal workflow and how easy it is to access and work with the history feature.</p><p>Mike mentioned its ability to work with raw camera images and John asked whether it was better to save raw images as PNG; however, David said that PNG, being an uncompressed format, tends to generate rather large images. It would be better to use something like EXR.</p><p><strong>Bernard</strong> then tried to demonstrate the infra-red camera he had set up using a Raspberry Pi to check whether they were being visited by a hedgehog; however, he was not able to make the necessary connection [because of a bug in the version of the ‘Waitress’ web server he was using]. So he showed the test video he had made to demonstrate that the setup worked.</p><p><strong>John<strong>rounded off the meeting with a presentation on <a href="http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2019/06/11/files/Spreadsheets.odp" type="application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.presentation">spreadsheets</a> to mark 40 years since the release of <a href="https://www.darktable.org/" type="text/html" role="link">darktable</a>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visicalc||VisiCalc]VisiCalc. He stressed the importance of using spreadsheets only for numerically intensive work and not for manipulating textual or sensitive data where a database would be more appropriate and more secure. In response to the point about errors in spreadsheets, David reminded people of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhart-Rogoff" type="text/html" role="link">Reinhart and Rogoff paper</a> which had been used to justify austerity but had significant errors in the Excel spreadsheet used to support the argument.</p>
