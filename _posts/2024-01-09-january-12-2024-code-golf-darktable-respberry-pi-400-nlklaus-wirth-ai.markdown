<p>Calyx meet was down for maintenance and Brian wasn’t around to invite people to Discord; so we used the openSUSE Jitsi instance.</p><p><strong>Darren</strong> said that at the <a href="https://www.keepingdigital.org.uk/digital-making/york-coderdojo/" type="text/html" role="link">York CoderDojo</a> he had had a go at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf" type="text/html" role="link">code golf</a> in which people aim for the shortest possible code to solve a particular problem.</p><p><strong>Mike</strong> said that, while <a href="https://ansel.photos/en/" type="text/html" role="link">Ansel</a>, the fork of <a href="https://www.darktable.org/" type="text/html" role="link">darktable</a>, is being cleaned up, it has still got a fault in it; so he has been using <a href="http://rawtherapee.com/" type="text/html" role="link">Rawtherapee</a> + <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" type="text/html" role="link">GIMP</a> but will go back and look at Ansel; Bernie noted that there has been a new release of darktable at Flatpak.</p><p><strong>Darren</strong> showed the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-400/" type="text/html" role="link">Raspberry Pi 400</a> keyboard which he had bought.</p><p><strong>Mike</strong> mentioned that he bought a fitting which allows filters to be used different cameras and had tried out a polarising filter to see if it would pick out fish in water which led Bernie to describe his experiences at the Malton auction and Mike to mention a Praktica and other items which he had picked up for about £20.</p><p><strong>John</strong> said he was thinking of checking out the <a href="https://www.nwcomputermuseum.org.uk/" type="text/html" role="link">Northwest Computer Museum</a> in Leigh and David and Mike said they would also be interested in going.</p><p><strong>Bernie</strong> mentioned the <a href="https://www.rigb.org/christmas-lectures" type="text/html" role="link">Royal Institution Christmas Lectures</a> on AI by Professor Mike Wooldridge; Mike, having met Chris Hobbs, was somewhat sceptical of the capabilities of <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt" type="text/html" role="link">ChatGPT</a> but Bernie said that Mike Wooldridge had explained the different types of AI being developed. For example, <a href="https://deepmind.google/" type="text/html" role="link">DeepMind</a> is looking at protein molecules which can take years to describe and has worked out the shapes of several thousand proteins.</p><p><strong>David</strong> commented that ChatGPT version 4 goes a lot further so that the output looks plausible but in a recent example a Chatbot learned to be racist!</p><p>David wondered if people realised that Sam Altman had been sacked from Microsoft owned <a href="https://openai.com/" type="text/html" role="link">OpenAI</a> for trying to set up a hardware company to use the OpenAI software.</p><p>David also mentioned that a court has struck down idea that photographer has copyright over a photograph of an old master.</p><p>The discussion then moved on the significance of methane produced by cattle for global warming before</p><p><strong>Darren</strong> noted that Google had fixed eight zero day bugs in its Chrome browser during 2023.</p><p><strong>David</strong> drew attention to the death of <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/04/niklaus_wirth_obituary/" type="text/html" role="link">Niklaus Wirth</a> who died on 1 January 2024. When asked how to pronounce his name, he said it depended on whether he was to be called by name or by value. He had worked on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL360" type="text/html" role="link">PL360</a>, an alternative assembler for the IBM360 in which register names look like variables; arguably C descended from PL360 which was implemented on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11" type="text/html" role="link">PDP-11</a>. He was invited to develop the successor to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_60" type="text/html" role="link">Algol 60</a> but, when all suggestions for improvements to Algol 60 from himself and Tony Hoare were rejected, he resigned and went on to launch Pascal which had invariant character strings; this was eventually fixed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula" type="text/html" role="link">Modula</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula-2" type="text/html" role="link">Modula-2</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_(programming_language)" type="text/html" role="link">Oberon</a>.</p><p>In David’s view, Wirth never came up with anything to be remembered by; rather he slipstreamed lots of other developments; in practice, his actions undercut <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_68" type="text/html" role="link">Algol 68</a>, whose features have nonetheless been shoehorned in Python and Rust to sort out problems there. David thought that Tony Hoare had contributed a lot more.</p><p><strong>Mike</strong> asked about writing BASH scripts; David recommended <a href="https://www.shellcheck.net/" type="text/html" role="link">ShellCheck</a> which will nit pick your scripts and John recommended the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.pdf" type="application/pdf" role="link">BASH Reference Manual</a>.</p><p>Mike went on to ask for recommendations for a language to learn and David recommended <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" type="text/html" role="link">Rust</a>. Mike asked how Rust handled <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/" type="text/html" role="link">OpenCL</a>. David explained that OpenCL conceals two proprietary systems and no-one is interested in developing a general version only versions for their own systems.</p><p>Mike also asked about handling high resolution images and David recommended <a href="https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_viewer.html" type="text/html" role="link">FITS</a>. He also mentioned that the printer wanted a PDF that would handle CMYK. David said he was sure that LyX/LaTeX could handle that [it can using the <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/pdfx" type="text/html" role="link">pdfx</a> package] while John said that <a href="https://www.scribus.net/" type="text/html" role="link">Scribus</a> could do it too. David added that you can convert a Tiff to PDF/X in <a href="https://imagemagick.org/" type="text/html" role="link">ImageMagick</a>.</p>
