<p><strong>John</strong> reported that the person for whom he had installed <a href="https://linuxmint.com/" type="text/html" role="link">Linux Mint</a> following the end of Windows 10 support was very happy with the result. He only uses his laptop for emails, the Internet and his camera, for which John had installed <a href="https://shotwell-project.org/doc/html/" type="text/html" role="link">Shotwell</a>. In response to a question about why he had not gone for OpenSUSE, John said that OpenSUSE is dropping support for the earliest versions of x64 chips in OpenSUSE Leap next year and his laptop would not have been able to use OpenSUSE Leap thereafter.</p><p><strong>Bernie</strong> gave an update on the <a href="http://www.indilib.org/api/index.html" type="text/html" role="link">INDI</a> terminal program which he is developing. He showed some of the segments of code which he had used, noting that, because <a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html" type="text/html" role="link">SQLite</a> can do concurrent reads but not concurrent writes, he had specified that everything uses a single thread. If no database is available, the program creates one.</p><p>Each segment is enclosed in a &lt;div&gt; and John commented that the HTML elements are really aimed at text documents whereas the segments are parts of a process rather than a text document; so this seems an appropriate use case for &lt;div&gt;.</p><p>The web server is <a href="https://uvicorn.dev/" type="text/html" role="link">Uvicorn</a> — the name arose from the use of <a href="https://pypi.org/project/uvloop/" type="text/html" role="link">uviloop</a> — and the templates are the <a href="https://www.makotemplates.org/" type="text/html" role="link">Mako templates for Python</a>.</p><p><strong>Darren</strong> is planning to do his final OU project on a comparison between <a href="https://www.python.org/" type="text/html" role="link">Python</a> and <a href="https://dlang.org/" type="text/html" role="link">Dlang</a>; he is also interested in the value of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic" type="text/html" role="link">Ternary logic</a> computing. David commented that it is trivial conceptually but its only advantage is in power consumption and he wondered if that would make it worthwhile.</p><p>Darren also mentioned that <a href="https://okular.kde.org/en-gb/" type="text/html" role="link">Okular</a> cannot handle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_2000" type="text/html" role="link">JPEG 2000</a> images; John noted that there appear to be no <a href="https://kde.org/" type="text/html" role="link">KDE</a> programs which support it whereas there are <a href="https://www.gnome.org/" type="text/html" role="link">Gnome</a> programs which do.</p><p>This led into a discussion of how inferior approaches can come to dominate an area of IT because people are not prepared to abandon what they already know.</p><p><strong>David</strong> mentioned that there had been a recent dispute within Debian when the <a href="https://linuxiac.com/debian-tc-overrules-systemd-maintainers-on-var-lock-permissions/" type="text/html" role="link">Debian committee overruled the Debian maintainer</a> in relation to a <a href="https://systemd.io/" type="text/html" role="link"><code>systemd</code></a> update. John noted that OpenSUSE had also declined to use some aspects of <code>systemd</code>.</p><p>David also mentioned the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/07/unix_fourth_edition_tape_rediscovered/" type="text/html" role="link">52 year old data tape that could contain the only known copy of Unix-V4</a>.</p>
