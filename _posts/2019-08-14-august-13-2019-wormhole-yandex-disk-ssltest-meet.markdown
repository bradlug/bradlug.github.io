<p><strong>Brian</strong> had hoped to demonstrate <a href="https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" type="text/html">Magic-Wormhole</a> which allows command line communication between two computers where the sender enters:</p><blockquote><code>wormhole send &lt;filename&gt;</code></blockquote><p>which generates a code which the receiver can use when prompted by</p><blockquote><code>wormhole receive</code></blockquote><p>to receive the file. However, Internet access was down.</p><p>So instead he demonstrated mounting a <a href="https://yandex.com/support/disk/" type="text/html">Yandex Disk</a>:</p><ol><li>create a folder, for example, <code>/media/yandex</code>, with 755 permissions</li><li>install <code>davfs2</code></li><li>obtain the host address, username and password from Yandex</li><li>create <code>/etc/davfs2/secrets</code> containing a single line containing the host address, username and password</li><li><code>chmod 600 /etc/davfs2/secrets</code></li><li><code>chown root:root /etc/davfs/secrets</code></li><li>add to <code>/etc/fstab</code><blockquote><code>https://webdav.yandex.com /media/yandex davfs noauto,user 0 0</code></blockquote></li><li>add to <code>/etc/rc.local</code><blockquote><code>mount /media/yandex<br>exit 0</code></blockquote><p>David queried the exit 0 as this can terminate the entire boot.</p></li><li>reboot.</li></ol><p><strong>David</strong> shared the <a href="https://vole.wtf/coder-serial-killer-quiz/" type="text/html">Programming Language Inventor or Serial Killer</a> Quiz.</p><p><strong>Bernard</strong> shared how he creates backups with an executable shell script:</p><blockquote><code># backup.sh<br># shell script to dump and encrypt the database to a backup file <br># using pg_dump to dump, then gzip to compress and ccrypt to encrypt<br># as postgres run this with crontab <br># crontab -u postgres -e <br># 30 13 * * 6 /bin/bash /opt/dbmaintenance/backup.sh >/dev/null 2>&1 <br># ie 1:30 afternoon every saturday<br>keypassphrase="set passphrase here"<br>file="/opt/dbmaintenance/backup.sql.gz.cpt"<br>export keypassphrase<br>pg_dump -o astrodb | gzip | ccrypt -e -E keypassphrase > "$file"<br># To decrypt manually use ccrypt -d from the command line <br># you will be prompted for the keypassphrase, # followed by gzip -d <br># <br># or use a similar shell file to this, setting the passphrase <br># into environment keypassphrase, followed by:<br># cat "$file" | ccrypt -d -E keypassphrase | gzip -d > "/opt/dbmaintenance/backup.sql"</code></blockquote><p>Set the passphrase and the file to which to export. The passphrase is exported as an environment variable which is deleted immediately after the script is run.</p><p><strong>Brian</strong> was pleased to report that he had got a top score when checking his server with <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/" type="text/html">SSL Server Test</a>.</p><p><strong>Darren</strong> demonstrated KDE Plasma 5 running in Slackware.</p>
