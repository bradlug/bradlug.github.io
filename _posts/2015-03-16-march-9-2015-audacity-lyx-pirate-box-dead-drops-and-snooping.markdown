**John H** began with a short demonstration of cleaning up digital transfers of LPs using the noise removal and repair effects of [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) to remove noise and eliminate clicks from the transfer. He then did a [presentation](http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2015/03/16/files/LyX_versus_Word.odp) arguing that [LyX](http://www.lyx.org/) outforms any other software in document production though there are a few uses cases for which it is not suitable.




**Alice** had brought along a [Pirate Box](http://piratebox.cc/raspberry_pi:diy) offline communications and file sharing system




[![The Home page with the chat line in use](http://www.bradlug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Pirate_Box_Home-300x194.png)](http://www.bradlug.co.uk/march-9-2015-audacity-lyx-pirate-box-dead-drops-and-snooping/pirate_box_home/) The Home page with the chat line in use.




[![Some of the files uploaded for sharing](http://www.bradlug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Pirate_Box_Files-300x193.png)](http://www.bradlug.co.uk/march-9-2015-audacity-lyx-pirate-box-dead-drops-and-snooping/pirate_box_files/) Some of the files uploaded for sharing.




When someone connects to the Pirate Box wi-fi it takes over the browser they open offering the chat line and the option to share files; it is ideal for groups who wish to share without connecting to the Internet.




Alice also shared [Dead Drops](https://deaddrops.com/), the project to provide anonymous file sharing by cementing USB flash drives into walls, and we watched the video.




**David S** drew our attention to the story that the [New Zealand Prime Minister](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/03/09/new-zealand-prime-minister-promised-resign-country-shown-engage-mass-surveillance-now-retracts-vow/) has retracted his vow to resign if New Zealand had been involved in mass surveillance. He also noted that though [Gemalto has denied](http://www.idigitaltimes.com/gemalto-rebuffs-sim-card-encryption-key-hack-claims-company-says-nsa-gchq-only-417427) that NSA and GCHQ had stolen USB keys, the Gemalto chairman Alex J. Mandl had a role in the CIA venture capital firm [In-Q-Tel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Q-Tel). Finally, he noted the case by Christoph Hellwig alleging that [VMWare is in violation of the GPL](http://www.zdnet.com/article/vmware-sued-for-failure-to-comply-with-linuxs-license/).
