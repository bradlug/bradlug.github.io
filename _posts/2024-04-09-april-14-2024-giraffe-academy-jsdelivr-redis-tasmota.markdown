<p><strong>Mike</strong> has been getting on with <a href="https://modx.com/" type="text/html" role="link">MODX</a> but had problems with <a href="https://www.cpanel.net/" type="text/html" role="link">cPanel</a>; Brian recommended looking at <a href="https://www.giraffeacademy.com/" type="text/html" role="link">Giraffe Academy</a> which offers up-to-date information on things you can do in the HTML and CSS rather than Javascript.</p><p><strong>Darren</strong> shared a query about routines to add words; having written one in D, he wondered whether the query was really from a student who had been set this as a an assignment; it was noted that in many languages this can be done with a + or a join.</p><p><strong>Bernie</strong> mentioned <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/" type="text/html" role="link">jsDelivr</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network" type="text/html" role="link">Content Delivery Network</a> (CDN) which can can serve Javascript from <a href="https://github.com/" type="text/html" role="link">GitHub</a>; all the Javascript files on GitHub are cached by the CDN so that people do not have to get them from GitHub. Mike noted that <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/" type="text/html" role="link">Cloudflare</a> and Google use CDNs for downloads. Steve added that CDNs were often used for video streaming; with the content pushed to a CDN, it reduced lag on startup though this is now less of a problem except for global distribution.</p><p><strong>Bernie</strong> noted that the licence for <a href="https://redis.io/" type="text/html" role="link">Redis</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/redis-license-change-and-forking-are-a-mess-that-everybody-can-feel-bad-about/" type="text/html" role="link">has become unfriendly</a> but <a href="https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey" type="text/html" role="link">Valkey</a> has stepped in to plug the gap.</p><p><strong>Brian</strong> shared some of his experiences of installing <a href="https://tasmota.app/" type="text/html" role="link">Tasmota</a>, the open source firmware for ESP8266 devices, on <a href="https://sonoff.tech/" type="text/html" role="link">Sonoff</a> switches controlling a wide variety of devices using the <a href="https://www.superhouse.tv/37-installing-tasmota-using-tasmotizer/" type="text/html" role="link">Tasmotizer</a>, demonstrating the configuration interface in <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/" type="text/html" role="link">Home Assistant</a></p><figure ><img src="http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2024/04/09/images/Sonoff_Configuration_500px.png" width ="500" height="500" alt="List of options for configuring a Sonoff from within Home Assistant" role="img"></figure><p>and the control panel for a device:</p><figure ><img src="http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2024/04/09/images/Sonoff_Basic_500px.png" width ="500" height="500" alt="List of options for controlling a Sonoff from within Home Assistant" role="img"></figure><p><strong>Steve</strong> had done something similar with <a href="http://www.gosund.net/" type="text/html" role="link">Gosund</a> devices; <a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Tuya-Convert/" type="text/html" role="link">Tuya-Convert</a> can flash Tuya, which offers firmware for a lot of devices, to the devices by wi-fi but newer Gosund devices do not accept Tuya; by contrast Sonoff is very friendly to Tasmota. The <a href="https://templates.blakadder.com/" type="text/html" role="link">Tasmota Supported Devices Repository</a> holds a compatibility list.</p><p><strong>Brian</strong> said that, with <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/" type="text/html" role="link">Home Assistant</a>, you only need one ESP8266 for whole house; he recommended the YouTube videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXKzFG61lNs" type="text/html" role="link">setting up Xiaomi thermometers</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOHp2o_-eNQ" type="text/html" role="link">connecting them to Home Assistant</a>.</p>
