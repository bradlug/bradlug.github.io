<p><strong>David</strong> showed how far he had got using his 3D printer to create the <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4621865" type="text/html" role="link">ESP32-Cam Pan&Tilt</a> as described in the <a href="https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cam-pan-and-tilt-2-axis/" type="text/html" role="link">Random Nerd Tutorials</a> which he had first mentioned at the <a href="https://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2022/01/15/january-11-2022-kontact-backups-konqueror-jellyfin-ad-silence-thingyverse" type="text/html" role="link">January</a> meeting. He demonstrated the USB plug he had made working as intended.</p><p><strong>Oliver</strong> commented that he had not used <a href="https://jitsi.org/" type="text/html" role="link">Jitsi</a> and recommended <a href="https://github.com/noisetorch" type="text/html" role="link">noisetorch</a> to improve the audio.</p><p><strong>Brian</strong> had originally had a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" type="text/html" role="link">Raspberry Pi</a> 1 running <a href="https://www.asterisk.org/" type="text/html" role="link">Asterisk</a> 11 to provide a PBX which enabled him to receive messages but until recently had been taking advantage of EU wide roaming instead; as that had come to an end as UK providers abandoned EU wide roaming, he had been looking to recreate his original setup.</p><p>He had tried using <a href="http://www.raspberry-asterisk.org/documentation/gsm-voip-gateway-with-chan_dongle/" type="text/html" role="link">Chan_dongle</a> and the <a href="https://www.dslreports.com/forum/r30661088-PBX-FreePBX-for-the-Raspberry-Pi" type="text/html" role="link">FreePBX for the Raspberry Pi</a> but they were out-of-date and he could not find everything that needed installing.</p><p>Oliver wondered about trying <a href="https://garronej.github.io/chan-dongle-extended-pages/" type="text/html" role="link">chan-dongle-extended</a>. <a href="https://wiki.freepbx.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=37912685" type="text/html" role="link">fwconsole</a> allows console based installation.</p>
