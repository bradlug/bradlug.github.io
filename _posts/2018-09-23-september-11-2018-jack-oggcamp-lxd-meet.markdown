<p><strong>David C</strong> joined us briefly to share progress on open sourcing BCB; he has been able to set up <a href="http://www.jackaudio.org/" type="text/html">JACK</a> using <a href="https://www.aelius.com/njh/rotter/" type="text/html">Rotter</a> as the audio logger.</p><p><strong>Brian</strong> shared his experiences of the well-attended <a href="https://www.oggcamp.org/" type="text/html">Ogg Camp 18</a> which included encountering <a href="https://quidsup.net/" type="text/html">QuidsUp</a>, <a href="http://wimpress.org/#page-top" type="text/html">Martin Wimpress</a>, <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AlanPope" type="text/html">Alan Pope</a>, <a href="https://webmink.com/about/" type="text/html">Simon Phipps</a> and <a href="https://bennuttall.com/about/" type="text/html">Ben Nuttall</a>. He had asked Simon about the possibility of LibreOffice on the Raspberry Pi; he said that they were not developing 32 bit versions which are what is needed for most versions of the Raspberry Pi.</p><p>Brian also pointed out how much easier it is to use <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Disks" type="text/html">Gnome Disks</a> to copy images, for example, to a Raspberry Pi, than using <code>dd</code>.</p><p>Alan Pope and Martin Wimpress discuss Ogg Camp 18 on <a href="http://ubuntupodcast.org/" type="text/html">Ubuntu Podcast 26</a>.</p><p><strong>Bernard</strong> shared his experience of setting up Linux containers using <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/" type="text/html">LXD</a> which builds on the existing <code>lcx</code> tools and <code>liblxc</code>. He noted that <a href="https://www.docker.com/" type="text/html">Docker</a> used to use <code>liblxc</code> but no longer does. Also Docker is more application focused that OS focused. LXD provides a set of tools to create system containers. The documentation is available from <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/" type="text/html">Linux containers</a> and <a href="https://lxd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" type="text/html">LXD</a>.</p><p>It is available for <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/" type="text/html">Ubuntu</a>/<a href="https://linuxmint.com/" type="text/html">Mint</a> and snaps are available for other distributions. It is command line only and you select the appropriate image using <code>lxc</code>, for example,</p><blockquote><code>lxc image list images:</code></blockquote><p>lists the available images to install. You can create and delete multiple images as long as you give each a unique name. You can also run Docker apps within LXD, something Bernard demonstrated for us. Full details are in <a href="http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2018/09/23/files/containers.odp" type="application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.presentation">Bernardâ€™s presentation</a>.</p>
