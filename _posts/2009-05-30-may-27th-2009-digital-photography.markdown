**David S** gave a gave a [full length presentation](http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2009/05/30/files/Digital-photography_27_05_2009.odp) on Digital
  photography: the free software perspective.




He started by pointing out that:






  * images are data: the marginal cost of an image is zero


  * optical physics is maths: post-processing is open to anyone with a computer


  * information wants to be free: there has been a net-powered explosion of both ‘customers’ and ‘publishers’.




It has become a democratised art where the only limit is your imagination. For example, [Panoramio](http://www.panoramio.com/) can compute control points on ’photos to create a panorama around several people’s personal ’photos. This conflicts with the old publishers approach.




Now you can take a ’photo with your ’phone which makes them spontaneous and ephemeral, especially when your ’phone gets stolen and save it






  * to another ‘phone


  * to a memory card and print it at the supermarket


  * via a cable from the camera to the printer (with [Pictbridge](http://www.digicamhelp.com/processing-photos/printing/pictbridge/))


  * via a cable from USB mass storage to the PC — Xcept Canon/Nikon which needs gphoto2




###### Displaying






  * Viewers



    * [GQview](http://gqview.sourceforge.net/)/[Geeqie](http://geeqie.sourceforge.net/)


    * [Gwenview](http://gwenview.sourceforge.net/)


    * [gThumb](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/gthumb)



  * Printers


  * Digital picture frame


  * DVD slide show




which turns a computer into a media hub unaffected by developments such as the cloud.




###### Image managers






  * [F-Spot](http://f-spot.org/)


  * [digiKam](http://www.digikam.org/)


  * [Picasa](http://picasa.google.com/) (needs [wine](http://www.winehq.org/))




###### Organising




Organising may be:






  * filestore centric


  * application centric


  * online




###### Publishing






  * [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/) — not very generous


  * [Panoramio](http://www.panoramio.com/) — landscape photos


  * fotopic.net — esp. trains, buses [no longer available]


  * [Picasa](http://picasa.google.com/) — more generous


  * [ImageShack](https://imageshack.com/) or [photobucket](http://photobucket.com/) — bargain basement


  * [MySpace](https://myspace.com/)


  * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/)


  * [Twitpic](https://twitpic.com/) n.b. not very secure; don’t actually delete pictures when you think they have been deleted




There are also specialised sites; choose the site that suits you; for example, [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/) has local Bradford forums. Use geotagged ’photos for geotagged sites. For uploading ’photos Pixelpipe [no longer available] is very good




###### Licensing






  * [National Media Museum](http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/) distinguishes copyright status where possible


  * Crown Copyright expires after 50 years


  * US Federal Government material is not copyrightable


  * GPL but must supply a copy of the licence


  * [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) — does not require you to supply a copy of the licence; you can use it to say there is no copyright




###### Understanding image capture




Image capture faults include:






  * poor focus


  * colour balance


  * poor geometry


  * motion blur


  * underexposure


  * overexposure


  * blooming (digital cameras only)


  * sensor noise (= grain)




###### Exposure is controlled by:






  * sensitivity (user setting)


  * aperture (per image)


  * → shutter speed




Because JPEG has lossy compression, the quality settings on cameras (resolution, colour balance, saturation and contract and sharpness) and are all about JPEG — always use the highest quality.




###### Post-processing






  * [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/)


  * [Krita](http://krita.org/)


  * [CinePaint](http://www.cinepaint.org/)


  * [F-Spot](http://f-spot.org/)


  * [digiKam](http://www.digikam.org/)


  * [Picasa](http://picasa.google.com/)




###### Order






  * geometry: rotate, straighten, perspective


  * crop/resize


  * brightness/contrast


  * colour: white balance/saturation


  * sharpen


  * histograms/curves


  * EXIF tags




Use curves and histograms to compensate for under/overexposure; a posterised image needs a RAW image; always consider perspective.




###### Never






  * re-edit


  * enlarge


  * add borders


  * add captions — use EXIF tags instead


  * use sepia




###### Specialised tools






  * [ExifTool](http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/): date/time, camera details, location — n.b. Firefox extension lets you see when ’photo taken; use date/time if cross timezone or battery flat and wrong date; consider privacy implications


  * gpscorrelate: to add location to EXIF [now abandoned]


  * [Fulla](http://wiki.panotools.org/Fulla) — to correct lens faults, e.g. barrel distortion, vignetting, chromatic aberration; n.b. needs a database of lenses — but owner now charges for details of latest lenses


  * [Lensfun](http://lensfun.sourceforge.net/) — possible free alternative to Fulla




###### Formats






  * JPEG — 8 bit


  * RAW — all proprietary


  * TIFF


  * EXR




###### Converting






  * [UFRaw](http://ufraw.sourceforge.net/)


  * [Luminance HDR](http://qtpfsgui.sourceforge.net/) AKA Qtpfsgui — HDR tonemapping


  * [Enblend/Enfuse](http://enblend.sourceforge.net/) — Enfuse uses an algorithm to calculate most important pixels and uses three (or more) ’photos with different exposures to create a better ’photo; n.b. don’t bother with noise reduction


  * [hugin](http://hugin.sourceforge.net/) — panoramics




David then listed the other topics one might cover and gave examples of a wide range of photographs which had been manipulated in one way or another. He argued that this had led to democratisation in that:






  * everyone is a journalist


  * everyone is an artist


  * everyone has freedom to use works


  * we have a better historical record.




We have lost






  * the ‘cathedral’ culture


  * craft


  * authenticity and


  * the long term survival of images.
