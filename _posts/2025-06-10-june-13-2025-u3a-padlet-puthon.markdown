<p><strong>Darren</strong> has been undertaking an OU exam which involved data mining using government websites, writing a program and then documenting the program. John commented that in the OU you get the marks if your method is sound even if do not get the correct answers.</p><p><strong>Bernie</strong> is a member of the U3A (University of the Third Age) Astronomy Interest Group Online (IGO) and has recently joined the <a href="https://www.u3a.org.uk/learning/interest-groups-online/interest-groups-online-groups/igo-linux-discussion-group" type="text/html" role="link">Linux IGO</a> which has some Linux hands plus others with Windows experience.

Mike disagreed and will continue to explore this possibility. David commented that one problem is the gap between the software as it is and what people want it to do for them.</p><p><strong>Bernie</strong> drew attention to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqBqdNIPrbo" type="text/html" role="link">Python documentary trailer</a> on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Darren</strong> suggested opening Python and entering:</p><p><code>import this</code></p><p><strong>David</strong> shared his examination of glucose meter sensors which Anita has also experienced as part of monitoring blood sugar fat.</p>
