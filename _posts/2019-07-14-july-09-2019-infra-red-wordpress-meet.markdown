<p><strong>Bernard</strong> showed us the results of his infra-red photography kit, powered by his <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" type="text/html">Raspberry Pi</a>. We saw, after some image enhancement in VLC media player, a hedgehog wandering past his hide, a crate in his garden [there was some dispute later as to whether the creature was a hedgehog or a rat].</p><p>We also had a browse round the logs of a non-functioning email server and its web client. It was not so amusing as a running system, but was useful as an object lesson in inspecting logs.</p><p><strong>Darren</strong> shared his intention to run a self-hosted <a href="https://wordpress.org/" type="text/html">WordPress</a> site. The opinion of most was that it would be too juicy a target for computer crooks for it to be useful to me.</p>
