<p><strong>Bernie</strong> has been working on a console based interface which he can use with SSH to manage devices controlled through the <a href="http://www.indilib.org/api/index.html" type="text/html" role="link">Instrument Neutral Distributed Interface (INDI)</a> using Python and the <a href="https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/announce.html" type="text/html" role="link">ncurses</a> library.</p><p>In the specific example he demonstrated, he sent a new target to change the temperature. But in practice, by setting vectors to be values, you can have the controls to manage multiple devices, as long as there is a driver for the device. It can be used with any instrument though Bernie has in mind those using INDI.</p><p>It is specifically a server/client system rather than a network system though it can connect to another server. Messages are sent using <a href="http://mqtt.org/" type="text/html" role="link">MQTT</a>. He demonstrated a Raspberry Pi running both the server and the client.</p><p><strong>Steve</strong> has used Python to develop a keypad which you can use with any machine. After he had developed it, he had asked <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt" type="text/html" role="link">ChatGPT</a> to write the Python to see what it came up with. To make the keypad he had used wire wrapping as, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_wire" type="text/html" role="link">enamel wire</a>, when you solder it, it melts the wire.</p><p>It was noted that the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-ipo/" type="text/html" role="link">Raspberry Pi IPO</a> had taken place at lunchtime; this relates to Raspberry Pi Ltd, in which the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/what-would-an-ipo-mean-for-the-raspberry-pi-foundation/" type="text/html" role="link">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a> has shares, becoming Raspberry Pi Holdings PLC. This prompted a discussion of where the Raspberry Pi could go next without becoming a direct competitor to the conventional PC. It was noted that there is the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html" type="text/html" role="link">Pico W</a> microcontroller and the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/" type="text/html" role="link">Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W</a> which comes with wi-fi.</p><p><strong>David</strong> drew attention to the episode at the <a href="https://meow.social/@tryst/112546598851850261" type="text/html" role="link">EMF camp</a> Camp where someone left two round metal boxes in the junk SwapShop intended for detecting ionising radiation; in ten minutes someone who works in the nuclear industry identified them and someone in suitable protective gear arrived to take charge of the radioactive material. They put out a message asking for the donor to let them know if there were any others [and the donor subsequently confirmed that they were the only ones]. David also mentioned the occasion when someone had left an unmarked keyboard for people to discover. It only happened to be controlling the lasers at the entertainment.</p><p><strong>Brian</strong> has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ElXDPw5c1Q" type="text/html" role="link">added Alexa to</a> <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/" type="text/html" role="link">Home Assistant</a>.</p>
