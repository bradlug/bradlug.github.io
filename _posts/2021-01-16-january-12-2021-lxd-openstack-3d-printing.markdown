<p>Brian, John W, Bernard, David, Darren and John H joined the meeting this month. Brian began by describing some of the neighbour trouble he was having before</p><p><strong>Bernard</strong> demonstrated how the content of the four projects contained in LXD containers on the <a href="https://webparametrics.com/" type="text/html" role="link">Webparametrics</a> website</p><figure><img src="http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2021/01/12/images/LXC_containers_360px.png" width = "360" height = "90" alt="Output of lxc list showing the specifications of the four LXD containers" role="img"></figure><p>was served to the web using <a href="https://nginx.org/en/" type="text/html" role="link">nginx</a> for the VPS as described on <a href="https://github.com/bernie-skipole/webparametrics/blob/main/docs/index.md" type="text/html" role="link">GitHub</a>:</p><figure><img src="http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2021/01/12/images/Webparametrics_360px.png" width = "360" height = "270" alt="Diagram of the links between the nginx server and the four LXD containers" role="img"></figure><p>The MQTT broker service enables projects to communicate if required and <a href="https://git-scm.com/" type="text/html" role="link">Git</a> capability is included so that projects on GitHub can be easily cloned on the VPS.</p><p>He highlighted the instructions for installing certificates from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" type="text/html" role="link">Let’s Encrypt</a>, noting in particular the line beginning <code>certbot</code> which allows you to specify all the URLs in one go. Using <code>certbot</code> also allows you to set up automatic renewals.</p><figure><img src="http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2021/01/12/images/Letsencrypt_360px.png" width = "360" height = "180" alt="Instructions for setting up Let’s Encrypt certificates" role="img"></figure><p>Finally, he noted that <a href="https://git-scm.com/" type="text/html" role="link">Git</a> has changed from using <code>master</code> to using <code>main</code> to get away from master/slave terminology.</p><p><strong>Darren</strong> shared the work he was doing in cloud computing with <a href="https://www.openstack.org/" type="text/html" role="link">openstack</a> as ‘infrastructure as a service.’ It just needs hardware plus a small amount of software which can be supplemented with modules according to need.</p><p>He demonstrated using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack#Dashboard_(Horizon)" type="text/html" role="link">Horizon Dashboard</a> module for configuring <code>openstack</code> and how you could use the GUI to add an instance to the cloud network.</p><p><strong>Brian</strong> mentioned a device he had got from <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/" type="text/html" role="link">AliExpress</a> which uses mobile signals rather than the Internet to connect with devices, thus avoiding the need to have an Internet connection in the UK.</p><p>He also mentioned that he had got a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realme#Realme_7_Pro" type="text/html" role="link">Realme 7 Pro</a> smartphone; Realme is a spinoff from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppo" type="text/html" role="link">Oppo</a>.</p><p><strong>David</strong> showed the heater he had bought to get the resin warm enough for his 3D resin printer. Mentioning by chance that he had two 3D printers, he explained that one was a resin printer and the other a filament printer; the latter can use different plastics, including ABS, but you need a high temperature extruder for ABS.</p>
