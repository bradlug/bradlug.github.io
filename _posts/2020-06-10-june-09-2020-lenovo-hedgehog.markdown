During the fine weather he had set up a Raspberry Pi camera illuminated by 12 infra-red LEDs and triggered by a PIR which took 40 second bursts of film from which they had around <a href="https://webparametrics.co.uk/" type="text/html" role="link">four minutes of film</a> of the hedgehog eating the food and taking a drink.</p><figure><img src="http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2020/06/09/images/Hedgehog_parlour_360px.png" alt="Plate and box under some bushes" width="360" height="191" role="img" aria-labelledby="diner"><figcaption id="diner"><em>Hedgehog diner</em></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2020/06/09/images/Hedgehog_equipment.png" alt="PIR to left with LEDs below and camera above" width="360" height="340" role="img" aria-labelledby="equipment"><figcaption id="equipment"><em>Equipment</em></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2020/06/09/images/Hedgehog_camera_360px.png" alt="Raspberry Pi camera" width="360" height="297" role="img" aria-labelledby="camera"><figcaption id="camera"><em>Camera</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Brian</strong> had recently installed Fedora, having had a problem with the openSUSE network installer.</p><p><strong>John</strong> discovered, thanks to help with various experiments, that the problems he was having with his audio were caused by two things: using his headphones which, being smartphone headphones, probably do not play well with a computer headphone socket and that chromium was automatically changing the microphone volume as he spoke. [Afterwards he discovered a setting in <code>/etc/pulse/daemon.conf</code> which is supposed to disable this behaviour.]</p>
