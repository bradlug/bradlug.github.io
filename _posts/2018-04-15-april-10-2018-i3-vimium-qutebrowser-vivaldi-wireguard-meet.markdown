<p><strong>Oliver</strong> shared his recent experiences of the <a href="https://i3wm.org/" type="text/html">i3 tiling window manager</a>. It is very easy to flip between tiles and between tiles in different workspaces which makes it easy to move between different terminals. i3 has a lot of add-ons but mostly they add bling.</p><p>This has been part of a search for applications which do not need a mouse. For example, <a href="https://github.com/gormanm/mmtests" type="text/html">Vimium</a> extension enables Chromium and Firefox to navigate web pages using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)" type="text/html">Vim</a>-like keystrokes.</p><p>He has also been trying out the <a href="https://www.qutebrowser.org/" type="text/html">qutebrowser</a> which uses Vim-like <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/master/doc/img/cheatsheet-big.png" type="text/html">key bindings</a>.</p><p>Previously he had used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux" type="text/html">Tmux</a> for which there are several <a href="https://github.com/tmux-plugins" type="text/html">Vim plugins</a>.</p><p>Following on from <code>qutebrowser</code>,</p><p><strong>John</strong> showed the new Opera based <a href="https://vivaldi.com/?lang=en" type="text/html">Vivaldi</a> browser in which he happened to have left a demonstration of the new CSS flex container.</p><p>This led into a discussion of the state of browsers and whether <a href="http://www.xanadu.net/" type="text/html">Project Xanadu</a> (c. 1960) would have offered a better line of development for the Internet. (David S thought not!)</p><p><strong>Oliver</strong> shared the sorry story of his Bitcoin investments, somewhat ironic as he had introduced us to Bitcoin in <a href="http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2011/07/04/june-29th-2011-open-vpn-truecrypt-bitcoin" type="text/html">June 2011</a>! More positively, he was able to report that <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" type="text/html">Wireguard</a> had found its way into the Linux kernel â€” see the <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/talks/netdev2017-slides.pdf" type="application/pdf">presentation</a> to the kernel devs.</p>
