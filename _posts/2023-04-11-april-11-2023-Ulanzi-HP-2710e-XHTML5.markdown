<p><strong>Brian</strong> mentioned the <a href="https://www.ulanzi.com/products/ulanzi-pixel-smart-clock-2882" type="text/html" role="link">Ulanzi clock</a> which offers a range of functions beyond telling the time, including the weather and the number of social media followers you have as well as coming with the <a href="https://github.com/lubeda/awtrix_python_script" type="text/html" role="link">awtrix python script</a> for Home Assistant and the option to install further programs.</p><p>He also raised a query about encrypting his Nextcloud files and David pointed him to <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/19/user_manual/files/encrypting_files.html" type="text/html" role="link">Encrypting your Nextcloud files on the server</a>.</p><p><strong>John</strong> shared his experiences of his new <a href="https://www.hp.com/gb-en/shop/product.aspx?id=26K72B&opt=687&sel=PRN" type="text/html" role="link">HP 2710e printer</a> which he had bought in a rush after the paper feed on his 6½ year old HP printer had failed. It is a wireless printer and comes with a new feature called Instant ink whereby you pay a monthly subscription of, for example £3 for 50 pages a month and £5 for 100 pages a month, and HP sends you new cartridges when you need them. This is managed through a smartphone app which monitors printer usage. The app also allows you to use the printer from a smartphone; so, because it was so new, John did not have a sane-backend installed for the scanner function but the app was still able to scan and also do OCR on images and send them to John’s computer.</p><p>John had opted for the £5 a month option which he estimated would cost him a third of what he had previously been spending on inkjet cartridges.</p><p><strong>David</strong> demonstrated how far he had got with developing a proper self-booting stack for <a href="http://www.slackware.com/" type="text/html" role="link">Slackware</a>; so far it loads the bootloader, starts <a href="https://www.denx.de/project/u-boot/" type="text/html" role="link">U-Boot</a> and loads the kernel but stops after 12½ seconds, David reckons, because it needs an <a href="hhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_ramdisk" type="text/html" role="link">initrd</a> but you cannot build an ARM initrd on an x64 computer; so he doesn’t know what to do.</p><p><strong>John</strong> mentioned that, in checking something out in HTML, he had discovered that there is now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5#XHTML_5_(XML-serialized_HTML_5)" type="text/html" role="link">XHTML5</a>, AKA XML-serialized HTML5, which incorporates all the new elements of HTML such as &lt;article&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;main&gt; etc. It is very useful in scripts and, if you know post-2011 HTML, it is very easy to use XHTML5.</p><p><strong>Bernard</strong> shared some more hedgehog videos including one of a mouse and one of a cat trying to get at the food. With the arrival of spring, the hedgehogs have become more active.</p><p><strong>David</strong> mentioned in the context of Gordon Moore’s death, the failed <a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/04/09/intels-iapx-432-gordon-moores-gamble-and-intels-failed-32-bit-cisc/" type="text/html" role="link">iAPX 432 chip</a> which he signed off but which influenced various aspects of the x86 including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_ring" type="text/html" role="link">protection rings</a>. It drew on ideas from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics" type="text/html" role="link">Multics</a> and was both bit-addressable and byte-addressable.</p><p><strong>John</strong> commented that it was interesting how some things, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80" type="text/html" role="link">Z80</a> chip created around the same time, have survived when others fell by the wayside.</p><p><strong>David</strong> pointed out that you can get a Z80 together with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and a mini-USB socket!</p>
