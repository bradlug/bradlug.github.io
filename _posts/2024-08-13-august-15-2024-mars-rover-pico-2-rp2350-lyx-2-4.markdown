excerpt: '<p><strong>Bernie</strong> gave a talk on the Mars Rover’s unique suspension incorporating a rocker arm, bogey and differential cam mechanism which keeps the payload at the same height while keeping the wheels on the ground all the time. It is all done with linkages which ensure that the movement of one wheel up or down is matched by corresponding pressure on the other wheel to keep it in contact with the ground.

<p><strong>Bernie</strong> gave a talk on the Mars Rover’s unique suspension incorporating a rocker arm, bogey and differential cam mechanism which keeps the payload at the same height while keeping the wheels on the ground all the time. It is all done with linkages which ensure that the movement of one wheel up or down is matched by corresponding pressure on the other wheel to keep it in contact with the ground. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzfz4iGS2BQ" type="text/html" role="link">YouTube video</a> is an animation of the action while this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTnMKAsFVhA" type="text/html" role="link">YouTube video</a> of a scale model of the rover suspension demonstrates its operation.</p><p>There are alternatives to this mechanism for different circumstances.</p><p>Bernie also drew attention to the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-2-our-new-5-microcontroller-board-on-sale-now/" type="text/html" role="link">announcement</a> about the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 and RP2350 microcontroller released last week. The chip has a one-time programmable key allowing you to install a public key so that only you can modify its contents. He noted that Raspberry Pi had obviously worked behind the scenes which lots of other companies which had simultaneously announced products using the RP2350.</p><p>We watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2C4lbbIH0c" type="text/html" role="link">YouTube video</a> about the manufacture of Raspberry Pis at Sony’s Pencoed factory.</p><p><strong>John</strong> gave a brief introduction to LyX 2.4.
