<p><strong>Steve</strong> gave a presentation on <a href="https://tailscale.com/" type="text/html" role="link">tailscale</a> comprising a <a href="http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2025/02/10/files/Tailscale.pdf" type="application/pdf" role="link">summary</a> and a demonstration. Tailscale provides an overlay network for <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" type="text/html" role="link">WireGuard</a> which is tricky to configure and use. Tailscale creates Tailnet, a virtual/overlay network of hosts, with a coordination server through which to register clients. It provides <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT_traversal" type="text/html" role="link">NAT traversal</a> and can set up a relay if that is not possible. Security is provided by asymmetric keys with public keys being shared by all clients.</p><p>Steve demonstrated his tailnet which has five clients, each with an IP4 address in the 100 range reserved for carrier grade NAT. He then demonstrated connecting to a server not on the tailnet via relay before adding it to the tailnet when it acquired an IP4 address in the 100 range.</p><p><strong>Bernie</strong> presented an introduction to <a href="https://nuetzlich.net/gocryptfs/" type="text/html" role="link">gocryptfs</a>, a file-based encryption system written in <a href="https://go.dev/" type="text/html" role="link">Go</a> that is implemented as a mountable FUSE filesystem. In order to encrypt files, you create a folder which will hold the encrypted files with:</p><blockquote><code>gocryptfs -init &lt;secretdirectory&gt;</code></blockquote><p>which prompts for a password from which the master key is created. You can then mount that directory with</p><blockquote><code>gocryptfs &lt;secretdirectory&gt; &lt;mountpoint&gt;</code></blockquote><p>You can then put any files you like into <code>&lt;secretdirectory&gt;</code>. When you unmount the directory, all the files in it are encrypted.</p><p>Reverse mode shows you an encrypted view of a plaintext directory.</p><p>The password is stored in the <code>config</code> file and can theoretically be broken by a brute force attack; it can be stored elsewhere but it is probably preferable to use a strong password in the first place.</p><p>It was noted that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup" type="text/html" role="link">LUKS</a> and <a href="hhttps://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html" type="text/html" role="link">Veracrypt</a> encrypt devices rather than files.</p><p><strong>David</strong> showed <a href="https://www.klipper3d.org/Measuring_Resonances.html" type="text/html" role="link">Klipper</a> and the extension he had created for it. He has to run Klipper to enable it to calculate the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> inertia when nothing is being printed before using it when 3D printing something.</p><figure><img src="http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2025/02/10/images/Klipper_400px.png" alt="Multicoloured connecting wires alongside Klipper unit" width="400" height="500" role="img"><figcaption><em>Klipper and extension</em></figcaption></figure><p>David displayed the Raspberry Pi 3, the <a href="https://libre.computer/products/aml-s905x-cc/" type="text/html" role="link">Libre Computer Board AML-S905X-CC</a>, otherwise known as ‘Le potato’, which Brian had recommended in <a href="https://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2022/12/21/december-13-2022-certbot-le-potato-docker-open-refine" type="text/html" role="link">December 2022</a>, and the <a href="http://www.orangepi.org/orangepiwiki/index.php/Orange_Pi_4_LTS" type="text/html" role="link">Orange Pi 4 LTS</a> which he had bought in <a href="https://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2023/06/14/june-14-2023-le-potato-awk-dbase" type="text/html" role="link">June 2023</a>. At the time, neither ‘Le potato’ nor the Orange Pi worked; now they both do.</p><figure><img src="http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2025/02/10/images/Pi-potato-orange_400px.png" alt="From top to bottom a Raspberry Pi, ‘Le potato’ and Orange Pi" width="400" height="800" role="img"><figcaption><em>Raspberry Pi, ‘Le potato’ and Orange Pi</em></figcaption></figure><p>David also reported that he had found that you cannot revert to an earlier version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_U-Boot" type="text/html" role="link">U-Boot</a>.</p><p><strong>John</strong> mentioned the decision of some distributions and some programmers to cease support for the earliest x86-64 chips as defined by their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64" type="text/html" role="link">Microarchitecture levels</a>. Henrik Bengtsson has written a <a href="https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/x86-64-level/blob/develop/x86-64-level" type="text/html" role="link">script</a> which returns the level of the CPU in use. Level 1 chips, generally those more than 15 years old, will no longer be supported.</p>
