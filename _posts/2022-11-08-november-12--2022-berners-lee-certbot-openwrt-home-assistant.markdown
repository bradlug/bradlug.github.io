Web 2 was the era of server based websites developed by programmers though his intention had been that the web should be WYSIWYG. The problem with server based websites was that the data was held on a server which was a long way from the user and had to be retrieved every time and which was not under the control of the user. Web 3 is about giving back to users control of their data by creating decentralised storage over which the user has control; so, for example, you would control your health records and give permission to your doctor to use them.

<p><strong>John</strong> said he had been at a hybrid meeting with Tim Berners-Lee the previous day when Tim Berners-Lee had explained what he meant by Web 1, Web 2 and Web 3. Web 1 was the era of static websites based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_(web_browser)" type="text/html" role="link">Netscape</a>, though the original design of the web had included the possibility of editing it. Web 2 was the era of server based websites developed by programmers though his intention had been that the web should be WYSIWYG. The problem with server based websites was that the data was held on a server which was a long way from the user and had to be retrieved every time and which was not under the control of the user. Web 3 is about giving back to users control of their data by creating decentralised storage over which the user has control; so, for example, you would control your health records and give permission to your doctor to use them. Web 3 is being developed by the <a href="https://solidproject.org/" type="text/html" role="link">Solid Project</a> which he invited developers to join.</p><p>John had asked about installing certificates on the old school association static website which he manages using <code>certbot</code>; it is not needed as there is nothing to steal but browsers are now marking it as insecure. The hosting provider, 123, is not listed on the <code>certbot</code> website as supporting <code>certbot</code>. David said you could ignore that and pointed to <a href="https://www.123-reg.co.uk/support/websites/how-do-i-install-my-free-ssl-certificate/" type="text/html" role="link">How do I install my free SSL certificate?</a>, <a href="https://www.123-reg.co.uk/support/hosting/manually-install-an-ssl-certificate-on-my-cpanel-hosting/" type="text/html" role="link">How do I manually install an SSL certificate on my cPanel hosting package?</a> and <a href="https://www.123-reg.co.uk/support/hosting/how-do-i-activate-my-free-ssl-certificate/" type="text/html" role="link">How do I activate my free SSL certificate?</a> which John will follow up.</p><p><strong>Brian</strong> had picked up a <a href="https://openwrt.org/toh/comtrend/ar-5387un" type="text/html" role="link">Comtrend AR-5387un</a> DSL router by a skip and showed how he had been able to get it working with <a href="https://openwrt.org/" type="text/html" role="link">OpenWrt</a>. He had configured the default <code>/etc/config/fstab</code> in the Comtrend router following <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Tailscale/comments/l1adgt/openwrt_traffic_nat_rules/" type="text/html" role="link">OpenWRT traffic NAT rules</a> as follows:</p><pre><code>config 'global'<br>    option anon_swap '0'<br>    option anon_mount '0'<br>    option auto_swap '1'<br>    option auto_mount '1'<br>    option delay_root '5'<br>    option check_fs '0'<br>config 'mount'<br>    option target '/overlay'<br>    option uuid 'be1c992d-f344-47a6-8638-0556bf707f36'<br>    option enabled '1'</code></pre><p>the UUID being that of the 8GB USB which he had added to hold OpenWrt because the router only had 16MB of flash but did have a USB port.</p><p>There is a good selection of videos on installing OpenWrt on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/VanTechCorner/videos" type="text/html" role="link">Van Tech  Corner — YouTube</a>.</p><p>He had installed <a href="https://tailscale.com/" type="text/html" role="link">tailscale</a> with</p><p><code>opkg update<br>opkg install tailscale<br>opkg install iptables-nft<br>reboot<br>tailscale up</code></p><p>and then followed the instructions on YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMnPE3CYo4&t=75s" type="text/html" role="link">Configure LAN port as WAN port</a> to configure the LAN port as a WAN port.</p><p>Brian also demonstrated using <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/" type="text/html" role="link">Home Assistant</a> to program the temperature and the lights in his house in the UK.</p><figure><img  src="http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2022/11/08/images/Configure_temperature.png" alt="Text of configuration" role="img" width="296" height="296"></figure><p><strong>David</strong> mentioned that, when you install OpenWRT, you can give names to IP addresses; however, in order to enable IPv6, you have to turn everything off and disable DHCP:</p><figure><img  src="http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2022/11/08/images/Disable_DHCP.png" alt="Screenshot of OpenWrt Interfaces & LAN configuration" role="img" width="400" height="200"><img  src="http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2022/11/08/images/Edit_Interfaces.png" alt="Screenshot of OpenWrt Interfaces configuration" role="img" width="400" height="200"></figure><p>as described in OpenWrt’s <a href="https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/network/wifi/relay_configuration" type="text/html" role="link">Wi-Fi extender / repeater / bridge configuration</a>.</p>
