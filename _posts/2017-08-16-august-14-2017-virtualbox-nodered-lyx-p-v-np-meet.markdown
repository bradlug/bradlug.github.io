<p>As a result of questions by Ash at the previous meeting and John W at this one,</p><p><strong>John H</strong> demonstrated <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" type="text/html">VirtualBox</a> with <a href="http://www.freedos.org/" type="text/html">FreeDOS </a> running inside it. He has yet to install any DOS programs to run in it!</p><p>He also showed the six lines needed to upgrade his system from openSUSE 42.2 to openSUSE 42.3 starting with <code>tmux</code> to deal with any breaks in connection during the upgrade and ending with <code>init 6</code> to reboot:</p><blockquote><code>tmux<br>cp -Rv /etc/zypp/repos.d /etc/zypp/repos.d.Old<br>sed -i 's/42\.2/42\.3/g' /etc/zypp/repos.d/*<br>zypper --gpg-auto-import-keys ref<br>zypper dup<br>init 6</code></blockquote><p><strong>Brian</strong> then gave a progress report on his project to turn a clock radio into an Internet clock radio using <a href="http://nodered.org/" type="text/html">Node-RED</a> beginning with a brief summary of the <a href="http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2016/09/16/files/iot.odp" type="application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.presentation">demonstration</a> he had given in September 2016. So far he had been able to set up a Raspberry Pi to link to three Internet radio stations and generate an announcement of the station selected. He plans to implement it on a Raspberry Pi Zero.</p><p>This led into a discussion of the range of possible inputs which Node-RED can use including <a href="https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-node-twitter" type="text/html">Twitter</a> and Alice commented that that they were using Node-RED a lot at work to assemble various kinds of data.</p><p><strong>John H</strong> then gave a quick summary of <a href="http://www.lyx.org/" type="text/html">LyX</a>, a GUI for <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/" type="text/html">LaTeX</a>, the package system developed in the 1990s to support Donald Knuth’s typesetting program, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX" type="text/html">TeX</a>, and the later programs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX" type="text/html">XeTeX</a> and <a href="hhttp://luatex.org/" type="text/html">LuaTeX</a>, which add Unicode support which did not exist when Knuth wrote the original program.</p><p>LyX follows the Unix philosophy of not duplicating what already exists; so images are handled by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageMagick" type="text/html">ImageMagick</a> and spellchecking by <a href="http://hunspell.github.io/" type="text/html">Hunspell</a> using the LibreOffice dictionaries. So it mostly sends scripts for LaTeX packages and external programs to execute.</p><p>LaTeX offers easy handling of parts, chapters and sections, bibliographies, multicolumn support as well as a range of minipages, a range of text enhancements and manipulations, customised colours and image manipulation.</p><p>The LyX interface offers everything you would get in a word-processor but with a dynamic outliner allowing you to move whole sections around or look for particular footnotes or citations, integration with a version control system such as <a href="https://git-scm.com/" type="text/html">Git</a> and an advanced search function which allows you to find and replace formatted input such as formulae.</p><p>It is not WYSIWYG but generates a PDF of the output for preview; it uses a tabbed interface which allows you to edit different parts of the same document simultaneously or to work on a translation with one language in one tab and another in the other.</p><p>However, John does not use it exclusively because export to Word formats is not straightforward. So he still uses <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/" type="text/html">LibreOffice</a> for anything which needs exchanging in a Word format.</p><p>There is a general introduction to LyX on <a href="https://johnrhudson.me.uk/computing/LyX_2_the%20ultimate_document_software.pdf" type="application/pdf">John’s website</a> and information on some of the more sophisticated features in <a href="https://johnrhudson.me.uk/computing/Tips_tricks_and_extended_features_of_LyX_LaTeX.pdf" type="application/pdf">Tips, Tricks and Extended Features</a>.</p><p><strong>David</strong> then pointed to the news that there is a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03486" type="text/html">possible solution</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem|" type="text/html">P versus NP</a> problem which would have massive implications for cryptography which relies on there being no easy solutions to the P versus NP problem.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong> drew attention to the changes in <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2017/02/16/the-road-to-firefox-57-compatibility-milestones/" type="text/html">Firefox 57</a>, scheduled for release in November 2017, which mean that older add-ons will no longer work, only WebExtensions. Even bigger changes are planned for Firefox 60.</p><p><strong>David</strong> revealed that <a href="http://pkgsrc.org/pkgsrcCon/2017/talks.html" type="text/html">his talk</a> at the <a href="http://pkgsrc.org/pkgsrcCon/2017/" type="text/html">NetBSD pkgsrc</a> conference had largely been repeated at the Gnome conference by Emmanuele Bassi and had gone down like a lead balloon there!</p><p><strong>John H</strong> drew attention to <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2017-08-08/linux-load-averages.html" type="text/html">Brendan Gregg’s blog</a> about Linux load averages and why they are different from any other OS.</p>
