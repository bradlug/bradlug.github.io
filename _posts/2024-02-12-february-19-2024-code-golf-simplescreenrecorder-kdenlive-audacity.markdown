<p><strong>Mike</strong> raised a problem he had had. Having changed a setting, he was unable to get back in to change it back. He knew where to make the change but could not find a way to get there. John suggested <a href="https://www.system-rescue.org/" type="text/html" role="link">SystemRescue</a> which has the virtue of not touching anything unless you tell it to do.</p><p>Once running, enter:</p><p><code>fsarchiver -v probe</code></p><p>to identify the partitions and their names. Mike can then mount the relevant partition in <code>/mnt</code>, go into the partition, make the change, for example, with <code>nano</code> and quit.</p><p><strong>Darren</strong> introduced the code golf example he had obtained from the <a href="https://www.keepingdigital.org.uk/digital-making/york-coderdojo/" type="text/html" role="link">York CoderDojo</a> using <a href="http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2024/02/13/files/Darren-Encoding.odt" type="application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text" role="link">this paper</a> to flesh out the details. The example focused on efficient data storage with strings stored as alphanumeric characters preceded by the number of characters and a colon, numbers in mantissa exponent format, lists enclosed in the letters ‘L’ and ‘T’ and dictionaries and their keys stored in a similar fashion.</p><p>Bernard commented that it would be important with strings to clarify whether the number before the string related to characters or to bytes as <code>utf8</code> characters can have between one and four bytes. He noted that Python2 was ASCII based whereas Python3 is Unicode based.</p><p><strong>Bernard</strong> then shared some experiences of making screenshots for a YouTube tutorial. He had found a neat way to display the relevant files using <a href="https://thonny.org/" type="text/html" role="link">Thonny</a>, a Python IDE, and been able to record them using <a href="https://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/" type="text/html" role="link">SimpleScreenRecorder</a>. A very useful discovery had been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wmctrl" type="text/html" role="link">wmctrl</a> which allows you to manipulate the windows in a window manager. Then he had put everything into <a href="https://kdenlive.org/en/" type="text/html" role="link">Kdenlive</a> — which he demonstrated. Finally he demonstrated how <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" type="text/html" role="link">Audacity</a> could remove the noise from his slightly noisy microphone line.</p>
