<p><strong>Darren</strong> reported problems booting from a USB and thought there might be a problem with Grub but John said that booting from a USB is normally handled by the BIOS and not by Grub.</p><p><strong>Bernie</strong> presented a simulation of the <a href="http://www.indilib.org/api/index.html" type="text/html" role="link">INDI</a> terminal program which he is developing using the <a href="https://www.textualize.io/" type="text/html" role="link">Textualize</a> library.</p><p><strong>Brian</strong> shared his experience of writing software with AI; in one case he had asked for a program in PHP to manage lots of documents with the same name in different directories and the AI software generated did exactly what he wanted it to do.</p><p>In another case, he had given <a href="https://gemini.google.com/" type="text/html" role="link">Google Gemini</a> a circuit to design with the constraints that it should use the <a href="https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/d1/d1_mini.html" type="text/html" role="link">D1 mini</a> and that all the components should be available from AliExpress. Google Gemini cannot draw things but it can describe them and so he had got a response — which he demonstrated — but had not yet tried it out.</p><p>In a third case he had tried giving all the arguments that were possible but had not got a result.</p><p><strong>David</strong> mentioned <a href="https://bsky.social/about" type="text/html" role="link">Bluesky</a> and someone asked about <a href="https://fosstodon.org/about" type="text/html" role="link">Fosstodon</a>; David explained that one of the monitors had adopted an extreme right wing position and the founders had left; so he had moved to Bluesky</p><p><strong>Bernie</strong> showed off his ‘History of the personal computer’ T shirt.</p><p><strong>Brian</strong> introduced the <a href="https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/server.html" type="text/html" role="link">Calibre Content server</a> which allows you to access your books anywhere; this is separate from the <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/" type="text/html" role="link">Calibre</a> desktop program for creating e-books. David noted that there is an alternative — <a href="https://github.com/seblucas/cops" type="text/html" role="link">Cops</a> — but this has not been updated since 2019; however, there are lots of forks.</p><p><strong>Steve</strong> asked if anyone had any experience of <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/" type="text/html" role="link">Alpine Linux</a>, which uses <a href="https://musl.libc.org/" type="text/html" role="link">musl</a>, <a href="https://busybox.net/" type="text/html" role="link">BusyBox</a> and <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:OpenRC" type="text/html" role="link">OpenRC</a> rather than the GNU Utilities; Steve was directed to <a href="https://docs.alpinelinux.org/user-handbook/0.1a/Working/apk.html" type="text/html" role="link">Working with the Alpine Package Keeper</a>.</p><p><strong>Brian</strong> demonstrated a conflict he was encountering when trying to update <a href="https://www.keepassx.org/" type="text/html" role="link">KeyPassX</a> on <a href="https://nextcloud.com/" type="text/html" role="link">Nextcloud</a>; it was suggested that it might be related to a timezone conflict. Steve asked how you could access files on Nextcloud and David said you could using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System" type="text/html" role="link">NFS</a>; Steve wondered if you could use CIFS and David suggested he Google it.</p><p>Brian has tried <a href="https://localsend.org/" type="text/html" role="link">LocalSend</a> to send files between devices but had found that there was a conflict with <a href="https://tailscale.com/" type="text/html" role="link">tailscale</a>. He had previously used <a href="https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" type="text/html" role="link">Magic-Wormhole</a> for this.</p><p>Finally, he mentioned a <a href="https://github.blog/open-source/git/git-security-vulnerabilities-announced-6/" type="text/html" role="link">security vulnerability</a> affecting carriage returns in <code>git-config</code> files which had been fixed that day.</p><
