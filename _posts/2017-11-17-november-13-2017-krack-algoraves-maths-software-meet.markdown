<p><strong>Darren</strong> had brought some cakes for us to celebrate his birthday and mentioned the <a href="https://www.krackattacks.com/" type="text/html">Krack</a> vulnerability in WPA2. David S referred to the part of this press release which refers to the early release of a patch by OpenBSD and the exclusion of OpenBSD from early notification of future vulnerabilities and John commented that he had read that Microsoft had included a fix in their updates before the disclosure of the vulnerability. There is a summary of the issues on the <a href="https://www.linux.com/blog/2017/10/tips-secure-your-network-wake-krack" type="text/html">Linux Foundation website</a> but, essentially, patching one end of the connection appears to be all that is necessary.</p><p><strong>Bernard</strong> introduced us to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorave" type="text/html">Algoraves</a> in which people dance to music which is generated by a synthesiser interpreting the code which someone is writing in real time. Some people see it as performance art. Typically, the coder will use the open source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider" type="text/html">SuperCollider</a> synthesiser. A simpler alternative might be <a href="https://mdoege.github.io/PySynth/" type="text/html">PySynth</a>.</p><p>Bernard shared a demonstration he had seen at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gksJ3emMps" type="text/html">PyCon</a> of <a href="http://foxdot.org/" type="text/html">FoxDot</a> which uses Python with the SuperCollider synthesiser.</p><p>David mentioned the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/sonic-pi-free-music-and-computing-resource/" type="text/html">Sonic Pi</a> synthesiser developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation and the University of Cambridge Computer Lab. There is also the <a href="https://soslug.org/home/software/audio/drum-synthesiser-hydrogen/" type="text/html">Hydrogen drum synthesiser</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDSTIQZv9vw" type="text/html">Microbit synthesiser</a> for which there is also <a href="https://therustyrocket.wordpress.com/2017/07/01/microbit-synthesiser-v2/" type="text/html">more information</a>.</p><p><strong>Darren</strong> drew attention to the <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2395904,00.asp" type="text/html">PCMag</a> article about CIA monitoring of social media and to the US ban on <a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-07-kaspersky-software-russia-ties.html" type="text/html">Kaspersky</a> which however, does not apply to the military according to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/kaspersky-software-banned-from-us-government-agencies/" type="text/html">ArsTechnica</a>.</p><p><strong>David C</strong> mentioned the problems he had had getting the anti-virus software off a friendâ€™s Windows 10 computer and enabling Windows Defender and also his exploration of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromebook" type="text/html">Chromebook</a> for Linda.</p><p><strong>John H</strong> drew attention to the bug in Apple Mail which means that it sends some attachments as <code>multipart/alternative</code> rather than <code>multipart/mixed</code>. As <code>multipart/alternative</code> means that the content of the attachment is the same as the body, some email clients do not bother to display the attachment, assuming it to be a duplicate. Katie Floyd offers a <a href="https://katiefloyd.com/blog/get-rid-of-inline-attachments-in-apple-mail" type="text/html">fix for Apple users</a>.</p><p>Tiring of all this technical chit-chat,</p><p><strong>Bernard</strong> showed us <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HL9b0U_Eg" type="text/html">Korean Beatboxer 'Bigman' Daeung Yun</a> before</p><p><strong>Darren</strong> drew us back to more technical topics with a question about the RPM version of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/apl/" type="text/html">GNU APL</a> which appears to be one release behind the DEB version. He is thinking of using it for maths. So John pointed out that <a href="http://gnumeric.org/" type="text/html">Gnumeric</a> is the only spreadsheet worth using for maths and statistics as <a href="http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~bdm25/gnumeric.pdf" type="application/pdf">Fixing Statistical Errors in Spreadsheet Software</a> and <a href="http://www.phusewiki.org/docs/2009%20PAPERS/SP06.pdf" type="application/pdf">On the use of spreadsheets in statistical analysis</a> demonstrate. It also has the best tools for creating and editing graphs.</p><p><strong>David C</strong> mentioned that he had undergone some tests as part of a research programme into physical performance and received the data that this had generated but it could only properly be analysed using proprietary software!</p>
