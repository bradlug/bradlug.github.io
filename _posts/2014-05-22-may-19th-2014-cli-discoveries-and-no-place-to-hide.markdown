**Brian** presented a number of recent discoveries:






  * [powertop](https://01.org/powertop) which marks as ‘bad’ processes where power consumption can be reduced


  * [reptyr](https://github.com/nelhage/reptyr) which allows you to transfer a running process from one parent to another


  * [screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) which, after you have run it, allows you to do what you want, log out and, when you log in, restore the screen with `screen -r`


  * [sshuttle](https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle) which can route traffic via a proxy server via ssh; adding `--no-latency-control` improves the speed


  * [speedtest-cli](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli) which you can download and run from the CLI in order to test Internet bandwidth


  * [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) which adjusts the colour temperature of your monitor to suit the time of day


  * [syncthing](http://syncthing.net/) which offers a more secure alternative to bittorrent sync




There are links and more information in the [presentation](http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2014/05/22/files/myDiscoveries19May14.odp). In relation to the reptyr example, **Olly** pointed out that [pgrep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pgrep) will find the PID in one step. In relation to screen, it was suggested that it might not be being maintained. [However, the manual, last updated in 2010, is over 2,500 lines long and ends with the comment: ‘A weird imagination is most useful to gain full advantage of all the features.’]

		


**David S** then gave us a quick tour of [the documents from No place to hide](https://archive.org/download/pdfy-6RloKGKhTeLllkMo/NoPlaceToHide-Documents-Uncompressed.pdf) highlighting, among other things,






  * the New Collection Posture: collect everything!


  * GCHQ is receiving ‘upwards of 50 _Billion_ events _per day_ (and growing)’


  * NSA's strategic partnerships with IT companies


  * the FAIRVIEW programme, running since 1985 in cooperation with a large company, to access ‘international cables, routers and switches’


  * more details about the PRISM programme


  * how MS worked with the FBI to help them get round SSL


  * how CISCO equipment being delivered to people was intercepted and doctored


  * the plugins they use to collect HTTP data


  * travel tracking


  * how to discredit a target.




He closed by pointing to an article on [how irrelevant Microsoft now is](http://semiaccurate.com/2014/05/15/microsoft-now-irrelevant-computing-want-know/).
