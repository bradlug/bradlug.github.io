Alice showed us how to use Selenium to record actions on a webpage and turn them into tests.
These are the links you need:



	
  * [http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/](http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/)

	
  * [https://saucelabs.com/](https://saucelabs.com/)


Some talk about Cuttlefish: [https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/cuttlefish/](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/cuttlefish/)  - which will adapt your environment to your changing circumstances.

Dave continued his command line talk which was NOT called the Human Centipede, but had a lot to do with [pipes](http://www.linfo.org/pipes.html).

Also it was our Birthday. Thanks to Richard for the Cake (it was not a lie!).
