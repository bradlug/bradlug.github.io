<p><strong>Steve</strong> asked about photodisplay software; John mentioned that David had done a <a href="https://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2009/05/30/may-27th-2009-digital-photography" type="text/html" role="link">session</a> on that many years ago when he had mentioned Panoramio [acquired by Google in 2007 and closed in 2016], Picasa [acquired by Google in 2004 and closed in 2016] and the bargain basement <a href="https://imageshack.com/" type="text/html" role="link">ImageShack</a> [moved to a subscription based service in 2016] and <a href="https://photobucket.com/" type="text/html" role="link">Photobucket</a> [moved to a subscription based service in 2017] but he did not know how many were still in action. [There is a list of active image-sharing websites on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_image-sharing_websites" type="text/html" role="link">Wikipedia</a>].</p><p><strong>Darren</strong> noted that, to specify a particular version of Python, you can change the shebang line; Bernie added that ‘python’ just goes to Python3 now. Steve commented on the many different ways of embedding strings in Python and Bernie said that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html" type="text/html" role="link">using f strings</a> is the modern way.</p><p>Darren has started a new Open University course which uses <a href="https://jupyter.org/" type="text/html" role="link">JupyterLab</a> running in a Docker container. He has found it easy to build a program but difficult to throw it away!</p><p><strong>Bernie</strong> confirmed what had been queried at the previous meeting: the Raspberry Pi shop in the Victoria Centre has vanished. He mentioned that a test of a lot of SD cards which say they are <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/developers/sd-standard-overview/application-performance-class/" type="text/html" role="link">A2 SD card standard</a> had shown that they aren’t — only high spec. Sandisk ones really meet the standard.</p><p><strong>Darren</strong> asked if it was possible to access <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio" type="text/html" role="link">software-defined radio</a> (SDR) over the Internet, for example, using <a href="http://websdr.org/" type="text/html" role="link">websdr</a>. Brian said that you need to spend a lot of money to get a decent SDR; you cannot use the tuner they show on a webpage. If you want to have your own SDR you’ll have to spend money. Steve said that, if you only wanted to receive, you could get a receiver for about £20. This had worked with an aerial attached; he could even pick up data from a neighbour’s weather station which he was able to decrypt to find out about the weather.</p><p><strong>Brian</strong> and <strong>Steve</strong> had got into a discussion about the <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview" type="text/html" role="link">Proxmox server</a> which Steve uses because Brian would like to run an <code>iso</code> in a virtual machine. Steve explained that you can built a virtual NAS server inside Proxmox and, while you can run LXC containers within Proxmox, you can run a Docker container inside LXC.</p><p>So Steve gave a demo of his Proxmox server running on a Dell Precision 4-core i7 with 24GB RAM. On the left was a list of the machines, most of them running in LXC. You can see the CPU usage, memory usage, etc.</p><p>Proxmox can run on bare metal with an <code>iso</code> or run on Debian 12. However, installing with an <code>iso</code> is very slick.</p><p>The <code>iso</code> images on a NAS are mounted on Proxmox as a share; you can download <code>iso</code>s, select an <code>iso</code> and upload it onto a Proxmox machine.</p><p>In response to a question from Brian, Steve explained that he has a subset of IP addresses which have to be hard coded but ones with 5 in the third octet are set by DHCP. He uses <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/" type="text/html" role="link">pfSense</a> on a gateway machine. You can start a machine with DHCP and then map Mac address to a static address which is picked up when it is next loaded. He has a container running <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/" type="text/html" role="link">MediaWiki</a>; for this you specify the network address in the <code>config</code> file as in LXC.</p><p>The main factor in Proxmox is the amount of RAM, not the CPU speed.</p><p><strong>Brian</strong> asked if anyone knew how to convert the AAX audio format. The <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-formats.html" type="text/html" role="link">FFmpeg Formats Documentation</a> says that:</p><blockquote><p>Audible AAX files are encrypted M4B files, and they can be decrypted by specifying a 4 byte activation secret.</p><p><code>ffmpeg -activation_bytes 1CEB00DA -i test.aax -vn -c:a copy output.mp4</code></p></blockquote><p>You therefore need the activation code to decrypt them.</p><p><strong>David</strong> mentioned the chap using a cigarette lighter to inject stuff into a memory bus, though it was pointed out that you have to have physical access to the machine.</p><p>He also mentioned the AI researchers who have been awarded the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/science/hopfield-hinton-win-2024-nobel-prize-physics-2024-10-08/" type="text/html" role="link">Nobel Prize for physics</a> and wondered what connection AI has to physics; apparently it relates to their use of statistical methods in physics in the 1980s to begin their work on AI.</p><p><strong>Steve</strong> mentioned <a href="https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html" type="text/html" role="link">Ventoy</a> which offers multi-boot for <code>iso</code> images; you don’t have to create a bootable USB; you simply install Ventoy on the USB and then only copy <code>iso</code>s for bare-metal machines onto the USB; you then select the <code>iso</code> which you want to boot from a list provided by Ventoy. It will accept anything, even Windows 10. Whether the <code>iso</code> will boot will depend on the hardware.</p>
