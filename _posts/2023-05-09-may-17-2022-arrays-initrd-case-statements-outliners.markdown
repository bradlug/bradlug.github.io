<p><strong>Darren</strong> had asked a question on the mailing list about array based programming and there was a discussion about this, including a reference to its antiquity [see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming" type="text/html" role="link">Array programming</a> in Wikipedia]. This prompted John to mention key values which Bernie said are used in Python dictionaries; these were originally unordered and then a way of making them ordered was created until a change in the underlying code made them ordered by default.</p><p><strong>Bernard</strong> had mentioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostr" type="text/html" role="link">Nostr</a> on the mailing list, a decentralised alternative to Twitter, but no-one had direct experience of it.</p><p><strong>John</strong> mentioned at KDE has a Mastodon client called <a href="https://apps.kde.org/tokodon/" type="text/html" role="link">Tokodon</a>.</p><p><strong>David</strong> had brought in a dBASE III utilities disk provided by Amstrad:</p><img sizes="49vw" srcset="http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2023/05/09/images/dBASEIII_files_400px.png 400w, http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2023/05/09/images/dBASEIII_files_700px.png 700w, http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2023/05/09/images/dBASEIII_files_968px.png 968w" src="http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2023/05/09/images/dBASEIII_files_400px.png" alt="Listing of files on a disk" role="img"><p>David had a USB-C device with variable voltage outputs of 15V, 9V and 5V but he was not sure in which direction. Inserting a USB voltage/current reader into the chain answered the question:</p><img sizes="49vw" srcset="http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2023/05/09/images/Voltage-current_reader_400px.png 400w, http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2023/05/09/images/Voltage-current_reader_800px.png 800w, http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2023/05/09/images/Voltage-current_reader_1200px.png 1200w, http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2023/05/09/images/Voltage-current_reader_1600px.png 1600w" src="http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2023/05/09/images/Voltage-current_reader_400px.png" alt="Voltage/current reader displaying values" role="img"><p>David had also brought in a range of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32" type="text/html" role="link">ESP32</a> SOCs with a variety of peripherals on each SOC, several subtly different, making it difficult when ordering to know whether what you received would be the same as what you already had. He also had a breakout development board for an ESP32.</p><p>David reported on his attempts to pin down the contents of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_ramdisk" type="text/html" role="link"><code>initrd</code></a>; it needs entries for root devices on a USB, for example, <code>dev/sda</code> and <code>/dev/mmcblk1p1</code>, so that he can boot a root file system from a USB. He has found three different kernel sources:</p><ol><li>the <a href="http://slarm64.org/" type="text/html" role="link">Slarm</a> kernel for <a href="https://www.odroid.co.uk/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=1027" type="text/html" role="link">Odroid C4</a>; however, Slarm is looping before it goes into <a href="https://www.denx.de/project/u-boot/" type="text/html" role="link">U-boot</a>;</li><li><a href="http://www.slackware.com/" type="text/html" role="link">Slackware</a> support for the Raspberry Pi; Slackware uses 6.2.1;</li><li>a self-built kernel; however, so far this doesnâ€™t quite work.</li></ol><p>Each needs to have <code>initdr</code> modified to use <code>dev/sda</code>; however, there is a problem with U-boot adding 64 bytes to the start of <code>initrd</code>.</p><p><strong>Darren</strong> raised the use of CASE statements, something used widely in dBASE; Bernard said that Python can use the output of a CASE statement; in <a href="https://peps.python.org/" type="text/html" role="link">Python PEPs</a>, people discuss additions, for example, by stealing popular ideas from other languages. [There is a discussion of CASE statements in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_statement" type="text/html" role="link">Switch statement</a> article in Wikipedia].</a></p><p>Darren also asked about outliners, in particular those which provide an outline of source code, such as <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/outline%2B.el" type="text/html" role="link">outline.el</a>, a feature of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" type="text/html" role="link">Emacs</a>.</p><p>John commented that editors like <a href="https://kate-editor.org/en-gb/" type="text/html" role="link">Kate</a> and <a href="https://bluefish.openoffice.nl/index.html" type="text/html" role="link">Bluefish</a> can identify sections of source code and collapse them so that you are in effect looking at an outliner.</p>
