<p><strong>Brian</strong> shared a problem he had with KDE Activities; there was a Default activity on the desktop but, while it was possible to give the activity a blank name, it was not possible to remove the icon identifying it.</p><p>He also mentioned a problem with File Associations for which he had downloaded a separate program but John was able to show him System Settings->Applications->File Associations which allows full configuration of file associations.</p><p>He then shared <a href="http://zim-wiki.org/" type="text/html">Zim</a>, which calls itself a ‘desktop wiki’ and which he is using for his notes, noting that he was only able to apply one style to text; John suggested that that might be because it was using separate fonts for bold, italic etc. rather than a compositing font.</p><p>The Search function quickly finds notes containing the key word(s).</p><p>He then shared his experiences of using the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/" type="text/html">PulseAudio</a> networking facilities; to do this, you need to install:</p><ul><li><code>paprefs</code></li><li><code>pavucontrol</code></li><li><code>pavumeter</code></li><li><code>pulseaudio-equalizer</code></li></ul><p>You can then stream or pipe audio between different devices on a network by configuring the various programs on the server and on the other devices.</p><p>Brian also mentioned that he had had a problem with the command line prompt when he installed some software and discovered <code>chsh</code> which allows you to change the command line prompt.</p><p><strong>John</strong> presented the belated <a href="http://bradlug.co.uk/blog/2018/10/11/files/BradLUG_the_tenth_year.odp" type="application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.presentation">review of the year</a> (our tenth) and this led us back to Tony’s presentation on <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" type="text/html">Let's Encrypt</a> and <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/" type="text/html">Certbot</a> in January 2018. Brian also mentioned that he hadn’t been able to get the new podcasts to download automatically when they went on <a href="http://itstuff.org.uk/welcome" type="text/html">ITStuff</a>.</p><p><strong>Darren</strong> said he had not been able to install <a href="https://vivaldi.com/?lang=en" type="text/html">Vivaldi</a> from <a href="http://slackbuilds.org/" type="text/html">SlackBuilds</a> but had been able to install it satisfactorily from the Vivaldi website.</p><p>He noted the long list of pre-installed Bookmarks, the Start Page, the SpeedDial tab, the numerous Settings options including Themes and Search engines to which John added <a href="https://yandex.com" type="text/html">Yandex</a> and then used it to find BradLUG.</p><p>Brian asked about the Notes option and John demonstrated copying and pasting text and an image into a note and then searching on it.</p>
