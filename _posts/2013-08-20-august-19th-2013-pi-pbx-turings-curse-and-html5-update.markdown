**Brian** told us ‘the things that don't go into the guides’ as far as using [FreePBX](http://www.freepbx.org/) on the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) is concerned, including:



	
  * getting at least a Class 10 SD card

	
  * setting up static IPs

	
  * getting a free domain name from [DynDNS](http://dyn.com/dns/)

	
  * getting a UK DID

	
  * setting up the PBX using the FreePBX web interface

	
  * explaining the differences between inbound routes, outbound routes and trunks

	
  * installing [`chan_dongle`](http://wiki.e1550.mobi/doku.php?id=introduction) to handle mobile ’phones.





These are [Brian's slides](http://www.bradlug.co.uk/blog/2013/08/20/files/RasPiPBX.odp).



**David S** showed us [John Graham-Cumming’s _Turing’s curse_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVZxkFAIziA), a brilliant talk from OSCON; here is the link to [the slides](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/en/assets/1/event/95/Turing_s%20Curse%20Presentation.pptx).

**John H** summarised the key changes to the HTML5 specification in the past year.

There is an [updated summary](https://johnrhudson.me.uk/computing/Some_notes_on_HTML.pdf) of [HTML5](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-xml:base-attribute-(xml-only)) which omits the Javascript material included in last year’s version. This is now in a separate summary [Some_notes_on_Javascript](https://johnrhudson.me.uk/computing/Some_notes_on_Javascript.pdf).

**David C** drew our attention to the following items:



	
  * the CiviCRM sprint on 13-15 October

	
  * the [first batch of videos from Libre Planet 2013](http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/first-batch-of-videos-from-libreplanet-2013-published)

	
  * the [official datasets for bus stops and places](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/NaPTAN) which the UK Department for Transport and Traveline have offered to make available to OpenStreetMap project

	
  * the Bradford City Council [audit of cycle parking](http://cbconsults.wordpress.com/2013/08/02/cycle-parking-where-is-it-lacking-substandard/).


**Alice K** reminded us that [Wuthering Bytes](http://wutheringbytes.com/), a weekend festival of technology is happening in Hebden Bridge next month.
