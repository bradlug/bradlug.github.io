title: End of Windows 10
---
<p>Free Windows 10 support ends on 14 October 2025; most users will be able to move to Windows 11 but some people will find that their existing computers are unable to run Windows 11. In that case they can:</p>
<ul><li>continue to use Windows 10 and hope that they are not hacked;</li><li>pay Microsoft for extended support — though this is really aimed at companies running a lot of Windows 10 computers;</li><li>move to Linux; or</li><li>buy a computer that can run Windows 11 and donate their old computer to a charity which can install Linux on it and pass it on to someone who needs a computer but cannot afford the cost of one.</li></ul>
<p>Which option is best for them will depend on how much they use their computers and what they use their computers for. Some people may find that they can do everything they used to do on a computer on a smartphone; some may find that keeping their existing computer and moving to Linux offers them everything this need; some will find that a program they use regularly will only run properly on a Windows computer. There is no ‘one size fits all’ answer to this problem.</p>
