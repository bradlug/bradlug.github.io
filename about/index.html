    <p><strong>Bradford GNU/Linux User Group</strong> (Bradford LUG or BradLUG) is a self-help group for GNU/Linux, <a title="More about Free and Open Source Software" href="http://www.bradlug.co.uk/foss/">Free and Open Source Software</a> users in the Bradford District.</p>
    <p>We have regular <a href="/?page_id=72">social meetings</a> and more <a href="/?page_id=47">formal meetings</a> where we might talk about something technical, or help people with their computing problems, or discuss and debate issues around technology in society.</p>
    <p>We communicate outside of those meetings using a<a href="https://mailman.lug.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/bradford"> mailing list</a> and this website.</p>
    <p>If you&#8217;d like to know more, we&#8217;d love to hear from you. <strong>For all the ways you can get in touch see the </strong><a href="../contact-us">contact</a> page.</p>
    <h2>Structure</h2>
    <p>We&#8217;re an informal group that has no funds, and no formal structures. Everyone that contributes to the group, does so in their free time.</p>
    <p>We talk about<strong> &#8216;members&#8217; </strong>and, while there is no formal means of membership or membership rights, we consider these to be anyone that has joined the <a href="https://mailman.lug.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/bradford">mailing list</a> or who has attended a meeting.</p>
    <p>Over time individuals have taken on roles within the group as volunteers to help things happen. If you have a question about the following then these are the people to address your questions to.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Bradford GNU/Linux User Group began in June 2008, with a post to the <acronym title="West Yorkshire Linux user group">WYLUG</acronym> list to see if there was any interest in starting a Bradford Group. This resulted in a meeting one Friday (in a pub in Bingley) just to get some people together. 5 people turned up and that was good enough to try again, this time on a Wednesday, in the centre of Bradford. We had 3 people and one apology &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t looking good&#8230;</p>
    <p>3 of us also went to the <acronym title="West Yorkshire Linux user group"><a href="http://www.wylug.org.uk/">WYLUG</a> </acronym> meeting in July to get some tips.</p>
    <p>The next attempt (a Wednesday in September) attracted 10 people, and BradLug was born.</p>
    <p>We now meet on the third Monday of the month at the <a href="http://www.bradfordcvs.org.uk/">Bradford Community and Voluntary Service </a>building. <a href="http://lug.org.uk/">UK Linux User Groups</a> give us a mailing lists, and a few of the members got together to get this website up.</p>
    <p>Lots of people help out in various ways to keep the group going. Some people donate time and/or resources, others very kindly pay for the hire of the meeting room.</p>
    <p>A<strong> big thank you</strong> to all of them!</p>
    <p>Over the years various people have provided financial support to the group (mainly to cover room hire costs).</p>
