We have a **formal meeting once a month** which tends to revolve around talks by members on a wide range of topics. Details of past meetings, including notes and links, can be found in [previous posts](/category/past-meetings).

Meetings take place from 7–9pm on the **second Tuesday** of the month at BCB Radio, 11 Rawson Road, Bradford BD1 3SH. You can find how to get there on the [BCB Contact page](http://www.bcbradio.co.uk/contact/).

As a result of our experiences during the pandemic, we are hoping to offer hybrid meetings (details through the [mailing list](https://mailman.lug.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/bradford)).

All the dates are in our [calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=j0levg4c0p2op08nf5elp3u50k%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe/London).

**Show and tell**  
If you would like to give a **talk or demonstration**, please drop us a line! Talks and Demonstrations can take on almost any format from show and tell to a more formal presentation. We would love to hear about what projects people are working on.

We would also like to hear about anything to do with the **Open source/Free software** movement so please, if you have talks or lectures you would like to give to the group, do get in touch!

**Get in touch about a talk**: [Contact us](/contact)

**PreLUG Food**  
Usually before the meetings, a group of us generally gather from around 6.00 pm onwards in Pizza Pieces on Market Street for the traditional PreLUG pizza or Pasta.

If you would like to come along and meet some of us before the meeting or if you are new to the group, do drop us an email and usually someone will be more than happy to meet and introduce you to the others as and when they appear.

**History**  
From 2008 for just over nine years we met in the Mabel Booth Room of Bradford CVS (photo above) but this room is no longer available to us.

BCB Radio has kindly offered to host us at their venue in the city centre, not far from the old meeting spot. Starting on Tuesday, 13 February 2018 BradLUG had a new home — though for two years, from April 2020 to March 2022, during the pandemic we met online.
