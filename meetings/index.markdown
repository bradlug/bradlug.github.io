We have a** formal meeting once a month** which tends to revolve around talks by members on a wide range of topics. Details of previous meetings, including notes and links, can be found under [Past Meetings](../category/past_meetings).

Formal meetings take place on the **second Monday** of the month in the [Bradford CVS Mable Booth room](http://bradfordcvs.org.uk/html/room_hire/room_hire.html), with people arriving from 7.00 PM onwards. The meeting room is provided for free by [Bradford CVS](http://bradfordcvs.org.uk/), but we will pass on any donation you may like to make to them (suggested donation £2 per meeting).

All the dates are in our [calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=j0levg4c0p2op08nf5elp3u50k%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe/London).

**Speak Up**
If you would like to give a **talk or demonstration** then please drop us a line! Talks /Demonstrations can take on almost any format from show and tell to a more formal presentation. We would love to hear about what projects people are hacking on.

We would also like to hear about anything to do with the** Open source/Free software** movement so please if you have talks or lectures you would like to give to the group please do get in touch.
